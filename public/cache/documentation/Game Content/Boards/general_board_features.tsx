They balance different player skills.\r\n\r\n## Multiplayer Integration\r\n*Top Dog* supports both local and online multiplayer with various functionalities like matchmaking and private lobbies.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nThe *Programming & Coding* team outlines the board logic needed for player movement, item interactions, and map-specific events.\r\n\r\nRelevant section:  \r\n- Pathfinding and decision making at forks in the board `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: GAME FILE LINK: development/programming_board_logic.json`\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- A focus on balanced item spawn logic is important for board progression.\r\n- Integrating unique, board-specific items enhances the thematic experience of each board.\r\n- Dynamic music adjustments are considered to reflect the location on the board.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [|Items & Power-Ups|]\r\n- [|Critters|]\r\n- [|Mini-Games|]\r\n- [|Multiplayer|]\r\n- [|Development Process|]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nAlthough the rhyming with \"cops\" is really fun, and I do want to explore\r\nthat board, I'm worried that people will think that every map will have\r\nthis feature; the rest of the blurb spans a description more of the\r\nwhole game, so I think a board-specific feature like this is a bit too\r\nspecific. Maybe instead the increased danger of running around the board\r\nas the game goes on can be referenced, since more traps/items get laid\r\nout by players while they all have more valuables to lose themselves? -\r\nDaniel D\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n> The main idea I have for players\\' strategy on this board would be to\r\n> make the board about risky investments, almost like you are constantly\r\n> playing a game in a real casino.
