Item usage is limited to one per turn, with items capable of modifying dice rolls.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Enchanted_Forest_Items.png`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Enchanted Forest Board Concept`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: enchanted_forest_artpass_230511.blend`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Tavern Render`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: acorn_concept`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [General Board Features](/docs/game_content/boards/general_board_features)\r\n- [[Theme-Specific Boards]]\r\n- [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n- [Enchanted Forest Critters](/docs/game_content/critters/board_specific_critters/enchanted_forest_critters)\r\n- [Mystery Mushroom](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/enchanted_forest_items/mystery_mushroom)\r\n- [Reap And Sow](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/enchanted_forest_items/reap_and_sow)\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\- Mushroom creature\r\n\r\n\\- Tree creature\r\n\r\n\\# Art & Animation\r\n\r\n\\## Concept Art\r\n\r\n\\- Shopkeepers\r\n\r\n\\- Host\r\n\r\n\\- Monster characters\r\n\r\n\\- Enchanted forest environments\r\n\r\n\\## Character Art\r\n\r\n\\- 2D character sprites\r\n\r\n\\- 3D character models\r\n\r\n\\- Animations\r\n\r\n\\## Environment Art\r\n\r\n\\- 3D environments for Enchanted Forest board\r\n\r\n\\- 3D environments for minigame arenas\r\n\r\n\\- Props\r\n\r\n\\# Music & Audio\r\n\r\n\\- Looking for music partners\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed deals with Jack and SMLE (electronic artist duo)\r\n\r\n\\- Sound effects\r\n\r\n\\- Voice acting\r\n\r\n\\# Gameplay\r\n\r\n\\## Enchanted Forest Board\r\n\r\n\\- Main board game component with multiple paths\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n#### Icons \r\n\r\nThese are icons for the tavern/shop that can appear on the map\r\n\r\nTavern_Icon_V2.png\r\n\r\nTavern_Icon_V1.png\r\n\r\nAcorn_Concept.png\r\n\r\n#### Concept Art \r\n\r\nA bunch of.png images and .pdf storyboards mocking up various parts of\r\nthe Enchanted Forest\r\n\r\n#### Board Concept \r\n\r\n\\\"Enchanted Forest board.PNG\\\" is an image showcasing the board\r\nstructure\r\n\r\n\\\"Heatmap.png\\\" is an image showcasing the frequency each space is\r\nlanded on.\r\n\r\n### Board Ideas \r\n\r\nThis is a document with some ideas for boards.\r\n\r\n# Easy Stages: \r\n\r\n# Medium Stages: \r\n\r\n## Phil's Grand Casino: \r\n\r\n### Layout:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nUse visual effects to highlight the different locations\r\n\r\nPan up from Wetworld to the Enchanted Forest.\r\n\r\nPan up from Enchanted Forest to Space Station.\r\n\r\nOr maybe pan down from Space Station to Wetworld\r\n\r\n0:30 - 0:45: Show gameplay snippets of maps\r\n\r\nShowcase board events\r\n\r\nShow new item shop mechanics\r\n\r\nemphasis on Enchanted Forest\r\n\r\n0:45 - 0:55: Demonstrate minigames.\r\n\r\nShow all 6 minigames\r\n\r\n0:55 - 1:00: Show off game stats\r\n\r\nNum of minigames\r\n\r\nNum of boards\r\n\r\nNum of characters\r\n\r\n1:20 - 1:30: Demonstrate character creation\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nGameGambler Item.png\r\n\r\nDouble_Up_Tennis_Ball_Item.png\r\n\r\nDelayed_Trap_Item.png\r\n\r\nDeclaration_Die.png\\'\r\n\r\nDeclaration_Die_Item.png\r\n\r\nDeclaration_Die (1).png\r\n\r\nCursed_Roll.png\r\n\r\nBattle_Buzzer.png\r\n\r\nBattle_Buzzer_Item.png\r\n\r\n### Enchanted Forest Items \r\n\r\nThese are images of items specific to the enchanted forest board.\r\n\r\nReap_Sow_Item_V3.png\r\n\r\nReap_Sow_Item_V2.png\r\n\r\nMystery_Mush_Item.png\r\n\r\nEnchanted_Forest_items.png\r\n\r\nCall_Of_The_Forest_V1.png\r\n\r\nCall Of The Forest V2.png\r\n\r\n### Character items \r\n\r\nThese are images of items that are themed around a certain character\r\n\r\nPaulie_Plane_Ticket.png\r\n\r\nDraco Hawt Sauce.png\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest.
