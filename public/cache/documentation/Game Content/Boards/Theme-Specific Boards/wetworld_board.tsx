	"content": "Wetworld is one of the thematic boards within \"Top Dog,\" defined by its unique underwater aesthetic. This board integrates water into both its gameplay mechanics and its visual design.\r\n\r\n## General Board Features\r\n\r\nWetworld is characterized by its submerged environment populated with underwater elements, such as vibrant coral reefs and marine life. The board layout includes traditional spaces, such as beneficial blue spaces and harmful red spaces. Special spaces are also present, hosting unique events and encounters. \r\n\r\nPlayers can collect \"[[Universal Items]]\" that allow strategic manipulation of gameplay. Items such as the \"[Phil Bomb](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/phil_bomb)\" add an element of risk and strategy to the board.\r\n\r\n## Theme-Specific Gimmicks\r\n\r\nWetworld's environment is dynamic, with tiles that may flood, allowing temporary access to new areas or items and carrying the risk of being swept away. The gimmicks are tied to the board's aquatic theme and influence players' strategies.\r\n\r\n## Critters Role\r\n\r\nThe \"Critters\" of Wetworld provide an immersive thematic experience and interact with players in various ways. \r\n\r\n## Development Process\r\n\r\nThe process of developing Wetworld is documented in \"[Board Logic](/docs/game_content/development_process/programming_coding/board_logic)\" and \"[Character and Map Asset Creation](/docs/game_content/development_process/art_design/character_and_map_asset_creation).\" The board has gone through extensive planning, design, and testing to achieve a consistent theme.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Wetworld Music\\Water World Demo 1.wav`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Wetworld Music\\Water World Demo 2.wav`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Wetworld Music\\Water World Demo 3.wav`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Wetworld Concept Art`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Wetworld Board Features\\Universal Board Icons`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [Critters](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/critters)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nContinuous polish of the Wetworld Board is essential, with a focus on enhancing the theme through gameplay elements. Testing has indicated that the dynamic flooding events are favorable, suggesting expansion on similar mechanics. Community feedback should guide further development and updates.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n> The main idea I have for players\\' strategy on this board would be to\r\n> make the board about risky investments, almost like you are constantly\r\n> playing a game in a real casino.
