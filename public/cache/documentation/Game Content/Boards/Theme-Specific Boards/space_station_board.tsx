	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThe Space Station Board in \"Top Dog\" is a game map with mechanics similar to Mario Party, set in a space environment, where players navigate through various spaces that trigger in-game events.\r\n\r\n## Main Features\r\n\r\n- **Zero-Gravity Areas**: Altering the movement mechanics from normal to floating in designated sections of the board.\r\n- **Airlocks and Transport Tubes**: Functional elements that move players around the board.\r\n- **Board Events**: Events that affect gameplay are tied to specific board spaces.\r\n- **Technological Traps**: Traps that players can set, impacting the board or specific areas.\r\n\r\n## Concept Art\r\n\r\nConcept sketches convey the theme and layout of the Space Station Board, showcasing the central hub, crew quarters, and laboratory areas. The art emphasizes the feeling of isolation in space with a competitive play environment. Concept art and mood boards can be accessed for further information. `GAME FILE LINK: topdog_spacestation_moodboard.pdn`\r\n\r\n## Music and Audio\r\n\r\nThe board features its own ambient soundtrack, complemented by sound effects corresponding to high-tech surroundings such as airlocks and computer systems.
