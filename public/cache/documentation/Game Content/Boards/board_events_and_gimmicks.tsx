	"content": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nIn \"Top Dog,\" players experience board events and gimmicks as they navigate through the game's themed boards. These features introduce unexpected twists and strategic elements.\r\n\r\n## Board Events\r\n\r\nBoard events occur when players land on specific spaces. Types of board events include:\r\n\r\n- **Shopkeepers**: Players purchase items or power-ups. `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Non-Playable Characters/Shopkeepers`\r\n  \r\n- **Phil Space Actions**: Trigger surprise minigames or other outcomes.\r\n  \r\n- **Critter Interactions**: Players encounter critters with various effects, dependent on the creature and board. `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Non-Playable Characters/Critters`\r\n  \r\n- **Unique Map Events**: Distinct events or gimmicks on each board, such as weather changes on specific boards.\r\n\r\n## Gimmicks\r\n\r\nGimmicks relate to the thematic identity of a board, influencing strategy. Notable gimmicks include:\r\n\r\n- **Board-Specific Items**: Unique items available on corresponding boards.\r\n\r\n- **Dynamic Board Elements**: Players must adapt strategies due to changing board landscapes.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Universal Board Icons`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Space Station/Concept Art`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Enchanted Forest/Music`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Playable Characters`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Music & Audio/Music Themes and Files/Forrest Music_ Demo 2 Excited.wav`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [Critters](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/critters)\r\n  \r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure balance of board events for a fun experience without frustration.\r\n  \r\n- Gimmicks should align with board themes and complement core gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n> different items/event spaces do different stuff.
