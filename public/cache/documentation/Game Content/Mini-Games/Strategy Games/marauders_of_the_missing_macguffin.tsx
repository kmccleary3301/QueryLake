The \"MacGuffin\" begins with a randomly selected player.\r\n\r\n### Gameplay Mechanics\r\n- Players begin at different corners of a maze-like map.\r\n- MacGuffin passes between players to avoid being eliminated by a shadow creature.\r\n- Mazes feature quick transport areas, orientation-altering sections, and special walls only the shadow creature can pass through.\r\n- An exit portal appears randomly in the maze after a period of time, allowing the player with the MacGuffin to win the mini-game.\r\n\r\n### Strategy and Tips\r\n- Monitor other players and the shadow creature.\r\n- Utilize transporters and shifting sections to evade the creature.\r\n- Carefully time the passing of the MacGuffin.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- **Maze Layout Designs:** `GAME FILE LINK: development/top_dog_marauders_maze_layouts.json`\r\n- **Game Logic:** `GAME FILE LINK: development/programming/minigame_logic/marauders_logic.json`\r\n- **Shadow Creature Animation:** `GAME FILE LINK: animations/shadow_creature_anims.json`\r\n- **MacGuffin Asset:** `GAME FILE LINK: art_assets/items/macguffin.png`\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [[Game Modes]]\r\n- [[Development Process]]\r\n\r\n### Developer Notes\r\n- Make sure the MacGuffin can be passed among players.\r\n- Shadow creature should obey maze rules and chase the MacGuffin holder.\r\n- Players are eliminated if touched by the shadow creature, with the MacGuffin passed to a surviving player.\r\n- The exit portal appears randomly and can only be passed with the MacGuffin.\r\n- The shadow creature's speed increases after the exit opens.\r\n\r\n**[Developer Brief](https://www.topdog-gamedocs.dev/briefs/marauders_mechanics)** - Includes information on game pacing and maze elements like transporters and dynamic sections.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nCreate Gimmicks\r\n\r\nTransporters\r\n\r\nChanging orientation\r\n\r\nDifferent walls for the shadow creature\r\n\r\nWalls that can be passed through\r\n\r\nMacGuffin\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want the MacGuffin to be usable\"\r\n\r\nMake the MacGuffin passable\r\n\r\nCreate charge functionality for throwing the MacGuffin\r\n\r\nShadow Creature\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want an enemy to progress the game\"\r\n\r\nCreate assets for the shadow creature\r\n\r\nAI\r\n\r\nMake shadow creature obey rules of the maze\r\n\r\nMake creature chase the player with the MacGuffin\r\n\r\n\"As a player I would like to be eliminated if I am touched by the shadow\r\ncreature\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nVictory\r\n\r\n\"As a player I would like to win if I reach the end first\"\r\n\r\nCreate victory scene or animation for winner\r\n\r\nEnd game when a player crosses the finish line\r\n\r\nMarauders of the Missing MacGuffin: Players each begin in a different\r\ncorner of a maze-like map.

Each heading (minigame assets, character assets,\r\netc) should have a general time prediction.
