The objective is to eliminate all enemy forces or capture specific objectives on the map. \r\n\r\n## Art and Animation\r\n\r\nAnimations for Little Wars feature engagements between units and a set of animations for each combat style.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\nAssets related to Little Wars can be found in the following directory structure:\r\n\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: development/mini-game_logic/little_wars``: Contains the core logic scripts and state machine for the mini-game.\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: art_and_animation/animation_libraries/universal_animations/little_wars``: This directory holds all universal animations applicable within Little Wars.\r\n  \r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"Balance for troops is critical. Ensure that no single unit type is too dominant.\"\r\n- \"Experiment with different types of terrain and obstacles to create a more engaging battlefield experience.\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n#### Minigame Assets  \r\n\r\n-   [Est. 35-40 minigames]\r\n\r\n```{=html}\r\n<!-- -->\r\n```\r\n-   Video tutorial\r\n\r\n-   Written rule description as well as accompanying control icons\r\n\r\n-   Assets for the minigame (2D and 3D)\r\n\r\n-   Minigame specific UI\r\n\r\n-   Will vary dramatically on a case by case basis, as an example little\r\n    wars will require much more work than quickdraw asset wise (both\r\n    share a background but little wars will require four fully\r\n    functional troops with accompanying animations, effects, etc.)\r\n\r\n##### Minigame Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n-   Blocking out/Testing -\r\n\r\n-   Art Pass 1/Testing -\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nQuickdraw:\r\n\r\n-   Quickdraw\r\n\r\n    -   \\\"western duel\\\" type\r\n\r\n    -   whoever reacts first wins\r\n\r\n    -   display a key you press and whoever inputs it first wins\r\n\r\n    -   round type system to avoid it being over too fast\r\n\r\n    -   There was an image here showing the gameplay of Quickdraw.

Bridges connect each island over rivers. Players can\r\n        select 1 of 4 buttons to deploy a type of troop.\r\n\r\nClub Club (jousting):\r\n\r\n-   Club Club\r\n\r\n    -   Players stand on a beam (battle beam) and take part in a joust.\r\n\r\n    -   Players attempt to knock the enemy off the battle beam and into\r\n        the ball pit without hurting their teammate.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest. They just go with the flow and don't hurt\r\nanybody. Reminiscent of a dandelion seedhead.\r\n\r\n**Treecles:** Slow moving tree-like critters that produce a crystally\r\nsweet treat so pals won't chop them down.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\nAdaptive Music\r\n\r\nAdaptive music means that instead of playing a prerecorded music track\r\non loop, we have the music adapt to what\\'s currently going on in the\r\ngame. For example, if you exit a village and enter a creepy forest, the\r\nmusic will change to something a bit more ominous sounding. We like to\r\nthink of adaptive music as a way of creating an immersive and cinematic\r\nexperience for the player.\r\n\r\nCharacter Themes\r\n\r\nTo help the characters stand out a little more, each character has their\r\nown set of specific tunes that will play at certain parts of the game.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\nI like the idea of puzzles and quests, but the core gameplay is a series\r\nof minigames with little story. So no traditional questing. I agree on\r\nthe \"multiverse\" thing, I think most of our conversations so far have\r\ncentered around one universe with some cohesiveness between levels. I\r\nalso don't know how I feel about \"action video game\" because the term\r\naction usually denotes fighting or shooting in video games, whereas Top\r\nDog will be a party game. - Ryan\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\n**Wetworld Critters**\r\n\r\n**Podlings:** A little octopod-like creature that dwells on the\r\nseafloor. Very friendly and cutesy, many pals are fond of them, as they\r\nmake good pets. Due to their \"clingy\" nature, they make great companions\r\nfor exploration because of their tentacle's cushion cups, which allow\r\nthem to grab onto multiple items at once. You can also bounce off the\r\ntops of their heads to launch yourself up into hard to reach areas.\r\n\r\n**Space Station Critters**\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\n### Story: \r\n\r\n> Phil has invited the characters to his casino for a fun night\r\n> celebrating the Top Dog contestants. Unknowingly, the players oblige,\r\n> thinking it will be a fun time. Little do they know that Phil schemes\r\n> to take every last bit of their coins and stars in a seemingly fair\r\n> way (just like a casino). Luckily, the players can use their smarts\r\n> with their items and strategies to see who comes out on top.\r\n\r\n# Hard Stages: \r\n\r\n## Grand Clock Garage: \r\n\r\n###  Layout:\r\n```"
