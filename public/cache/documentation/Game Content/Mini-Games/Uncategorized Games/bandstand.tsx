There is no conductor roleâ€”participants play instruments and adapt to the changing speed of the music.\r\n\r\n## Notable Features\r\n\r\n- Rhythmic Gameplay: Players press corresponding buttons along with the rhythm.\r\n- Increasing Difficulty: The song's tempo increases, challenging players.\r\n  \r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/mini-games/bandstand.logic`: Core logic and scripts.\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: resources/music_and_audio/bandstand_theme.mid`: Theme song MIDI file.\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: animations/character_specific_animations/bandstand`: Characters' animations.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Music & Audio]]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nBandstand:\r\n\r\n-   Better Mario Party Bandstand\r\n\r\n    -   Heavy inspiration from [[this\r\n        game]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOCTCSh-JwA),\r\n        except we don\\'t make it for babies.\r\n\r\n    -   Notes don\\'t fall on the down beat of the music, so it\\'s harder\r\n        to get the rhythm correct.\r\n\r\n    -   The song gets faster as time goes on.\r\n\r\n    -   No conductor role at all.
