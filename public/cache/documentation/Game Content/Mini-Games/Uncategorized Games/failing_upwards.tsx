Players platform their way up the building with many gimmicks, including swinging ladders, malfunctioning scaffolding, and jutting construction beams.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n- **Modular Design**: Modular building pieces allow for procedural generation, adding variety to each play session.\r\n- **Platform Diversity**: Small tricky platforms, such as AC units, contribute to diverse challenges.\r\n  \r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/Mini-Games/Failing Upwards/FailingUpwardsSectionDesign.gslides`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/Mini-Games/Failing Upwards/failing upwards platform design doc.pdn`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/Mini-Games/Failing Upwards/Items.gdoc` \r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/Mini-Games/Failing Upwards/Failing Upwards Design.gdoc`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n\"Let's make sure to playtest Failing Upwards with varying player skill levels to fine-tune the difficulty curve.\" - Quality Assurance Team Lead\r\n\r\n--- \r\n**Document Written By**: Top Dog Senior Video Game Director\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\ni.  For Failing Upwards, obviously we will have to test how it plays\r\n        first, but I think this could be a great opportunity to focus\r\n        less on the platforming and more on it being a fighting minigame\r\n        that mario party usually has where you can punch, kick, and\r\n        ground pound other players to keep them from winning. The camera\r\n        would still pan up the building while players climb ladders and\r\n        jump between platforms, but if we struggle with the level design\r\n        a good solution could be shifting the fun to pushing other\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n\\- Different spacesuit designs for inside vs outside station\r\n\r\n\\- Screenshots rendered of environments to showcase art\r\n\r\n\\- Both day and night time versions\r\n\r\n\\- With and without board spaces\r\n\r\n\\- Discussions on lighting and halo effects\r\n\r\nMinigames:\r\n\r\n\\- No Cakewalk\r\n\r\n\\- Cake environment design and decorations\r\n\r\n\\- Glass bridge modeling and breaking animations\r\n\r\n\\- Camera angles and banners discussed\r\n\r\n\\- Failing Upwards\r\n\r\n\\- Modular building pieces for procedural generation\r\n\r\n\\- Small tricky platforms like AC units\r\n\r\n\\- Overall theming and modeling\r\n\r\n\\- Bandstand\r\n\r\n\\- Theater curtain animation\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nEach weapon has a \"rating\".
