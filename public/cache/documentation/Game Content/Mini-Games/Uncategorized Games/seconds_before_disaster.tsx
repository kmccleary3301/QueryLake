	"content": "## Gameplay\r\n\"Seconds Before Disaster\" is a high-stakes, fast-paced mini-game in _Top Dog_ where players must quickly respond to unpredictable, dire situations on a dueling ground. The gameplay involves characters drawing randomized weapons from boxes to duel against each other after the primary duelists incapacitate each other.\r\n\r\n## Mechanics\r\nPlayers face off by selecting from concealed weapons with varying effectiveness. The game is turn-based, with players unveiling their weapons simultaneously after a countdown. The duels continue with winners immediately facing off in a subsequent duel until one winner remains.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThe mini-game requires mechanics such as:\r\n- Randomized weapon selection\r\n- Dueling animations and effects\r\n- A distinctive audio cue for weapon draws and duels\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: development/mini-games/Seconds_Before_Disaster/weapon_ratings.json`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: art_assets/characters/dueling_animations.psd`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: music_audio/effects/duel_cues.mp3`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- \"`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Dual Mechanics`\"\r\n- \"`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Music & Audio Design`\"\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- \"Audio cues for weapon draws and duels must be sharp and distinct.

The two principal duelists cartoonishly\r\nincapacitate each other, forcing the seconds to begrudgingly step up to\r\nthe mark.\r\n\r\nMonocled pals present the players with a number of boxes. Players select\r\na box without knowing what's inside, while their characters hide the\r\nchosen weapon under a large worn cloak. After a short count, the two\r\ncharacters pull their weapons and fire; these weapons can range from\r\nwater pistols to massive steampunk cannons.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nA button appears over player's opponent. They must press this button\r\nfaster than their opponent presses their button. The other two players\r\nhave their respective match at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe screen darkens. A slash appears from the winner to loser sides. The\r\nlosers' ropes are cut and their lanterns float away.\r\n\r\nWinners immediately turn to each other and face off in the same manner.\r\nThe winner of that wins the round.\r\n\r\nAfter a screen transition, the second round begins. Second round is a\r\n2v2.\r\n\r\nMiner Problems (2D Shooter)\r\n\r\nScene Breakdown\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n\\- Witch\\'s hut\r\n\r\n\\- Used for item upgrading\r\n\r\n\\- Spooky aesthetic\r\n\r\n\\- Surrounded by pine trees\r\n\r\n\\- Lit cauldron\r\n\r\n\\- Pumpkin patch\r\n\r\n\\- Thorny plants\r\n\r\n\\- Tavern\r\n\r\n\\- Large building\r\n\r\n\\- Second shop with high value items\r\n\r\n\\- Attached outhouse\r\n\r\n\\- Mushroom shop\r\n\r\n\\- Located by riverbank\r\n\r\n\\- Fairy ring with glowing sprites\r\n\r\n\\## Paths\r\n\r\n\\- Main path starts in town and climbs tree\r\n\r\n\\- Alternate risk/reward routes\r\n\r\n\\- Paths use dirt and stone textures\r\n\r\n\\- Glowing mushrooms mark some paths\r\n\r\n\\- Vines crossing path in some areas\r\n\r\n\\## Backgrounds\r\n\r\n\\- Distant village on right with exaggerated shapes\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nHas a mild fascination with conspiracy theories, though they don't\r\nreally believe most of them.\r\n\r\nName: Finn\r\n\r\nBio:\r\n\r\nFinn is full to the brim with confidence, first in themselves and second\r\nin their muscles.
