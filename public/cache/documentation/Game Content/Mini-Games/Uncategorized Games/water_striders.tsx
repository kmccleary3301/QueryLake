Players navigate by hopping across rocks, floating logs, and swinging off of vines. The river divides into thirds lengthwise, each represented by a unique input command.\r\n\r\n### River Course Navigation\r\n\r\nEach section of the river is linked to a unique input command, demanding precision and quick decision-making from players. Obstacles may alter required inputs, testing reflexes and adaptability.\r\n\r\n### Obstacle Interaction\r\n\r\nPlayers interact with various objects like rocks, logs, and vines which provide safe points or shortcuts within the course.\r\n\r\n### Penalties and Hesitations\r\n\r\nIncorrect inputs cause character hesitations, resulting in a loss of time as they regain their balance.\r\n\r\n### Victory Condition\r\n\r\nThe first player to successfully navigate the river course and reach the end wins the minigame.\r\n\r\n## Strategy and Skill\r\n\r\nThe minigame's success relies on mastery of the course's patterns, prediction of obstacles, and manipulation of game mechanics.\r\n\r\n## Developmental Aspects\r\n\r\nDevelopment focuses on designing river obstacles, creating a responsive input system, and forming an immersive course environment. Attention to river currents is vital for a scalable difficulty level within the game.\r\n\r\n### Input System Creation\r\n\r\nAn intuitive input system is necessary to ensure a fair and engaging experience for participants.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Difficulty\r\n\r\nEnvironmental factors, such as water currents, affect difficulty levels, providing scalable challenges.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Assets/Minigames/Water_Striders/Animations``\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Assets/Minigames/Water_Striders/Scripts``\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Assets/Minigames/Water_Striders/Sound_Effects``\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- \"[[Characters]]\"\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nFocus is on visual and audio cues for guiding players. Immediate feedback upon success or mistakes is critical for gameplay flow.\r\n\r\n- Game Designer's Memo: \"Instant reaction to player input is imperative. Delays or lags disrupt the game flow and reduce enjoyment.\"\r\n- Environmental Artist's Note: \"Consider water shaders and particle effects for splashes to enhance immersion.\"\r\n- QA Team Report: \"Obstacle collision detection bugs have been resolved. Ongoing monitoring is needed during playtesting sessions.\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nClyde_Icon_Simple (1).png\r\n\r\nClyde_Character_Icon.png\r\n\r\nCatherine_Icon_Simple.png\r\n\r\n### DougModelReal \r\n\r\nAn animation file for doug\r\n\r\nDougModelReal - SampleScene - Windows\\_ Mac\\_ Linux - Unity 2021.3.1f1\r\nPersonal \\_DX11\\_ 2022-05-24 12-46-32\r\n\r\n## Boards \r\n\r\n### Wetworld \r\n\r\nMusic files for Wetworld:\r\n\r\n\\\"Water World Demo 1.wav\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Water World Demo 2.wav\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Water World Demo 3.wav\\\"\r\n\r\n### Universal Board Icons \r\n\r\nSpaceProtoRed.png\r\n\r\nSpaceProtoOrbGif.gif\r\n\r\nSpaceProtoHappen.jpeg\r\n\r\nSpaceProtoBlue.png\r\n\r\nDice Spin Concept.png\r\n\r\n### Space Station \r\n\r\nThese are mockups for the outside view of the space station\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nCreate scene for victory\r\n\r\nWater Striders: Players navigate down a river course by hopping across\r\nrocks, floating logs, and swinging off of vines.
