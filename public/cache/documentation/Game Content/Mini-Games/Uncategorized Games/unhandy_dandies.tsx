In this game mode, players act as dandy ranchers, rounding up stray Dandies by collecting those that match their assigned color with nets.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\n\r\nPlayers use nets to capture their colored Dandies that spawn randomly around the play area. Nets colliding with each other will bounce off and cancel any captures during that swing. When a net hits a player, it stuns them; the stunned player then enters a grace period where further stunning is not possible. The game continues until a player captures all their assigned Dandies.\r\n\r\n## Controls and Interaction\r\n\r\nThe main interactions involve using nets to collect Dandies and stun opponents. The game keeps count of the Dandies collected by each player.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- It's important for collision detection between nets to be highly responsive to complement the mini-game's pace.\r\n- The mechanics of net swinging and Dandy capturing may require adjustments for balance and enjoyment.\r\n- Adding special Dandies could introduce more depth to gameplay.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [Critters](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/critters)\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Game Content]]\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Character_Models/Unhandy_Dandies_Net.blend`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Environments/Ranch/Unhandy_Dandies_Area.blend`\r\n\r\n![Unhandy Dandies Sketch](GAME FILE LINK: Unhandy_Dandies_Sketch.png)\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nStop AutoScroller\r\n\r\nVictory Screen\r\n\r\nCelebrate winners\r\n\r\nPan to losers\r\n\r\nUnhandy Dandies: Players are dandy ranchers tasked with rounding up\r\nstray dandies.
