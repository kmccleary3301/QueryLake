	"content": "## Gameplay Overview\r\n\r\nHyper Laser Tag is a top-down free-for-all minigame that combines strategic maneuvering, quick reflexes, and precise shooting. Set on a stage with hazards, players compete by moving around, shooting in specified directions, rolling to dodge attacks, and briefly reflecting incoming shots with precise timing.\r\n\r\n## Core Mechanics\r\n\r\n- **Movement:** Players can move around the arena, utilizing obstacles and cover to avoid incoming fire.\r\n\r\n- **Shooting:** Players shoot projectiles in a chosen direction. Projectiles travel until they hit an opponent, an obstacle, or exit the play area.\r\n\r\n- **Rolling:** A defensive maneuver to quickly dodge incoming projectiles. Rolling has a cooldown to prevent spamming.\r\n\r\n- **Reflecting Shots:** Players can very briefly reflect shots that would hit them. This mechanic adds a layer of skill and requires precise timing.\r\n\r\n- **Hit Points:** Players can be hit a number of times before being removed from play.\r\n  \r\n## Multiplayer and Networking\r\n\r\n- **Local and Online Play:** Hyper Laser Tag supports both local multiplayer and online matchmaking.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: minigames/Hyper Laser Tag/`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Action Games]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"After playtesting, we've adjusted the rate of stage evolution to balance the pacing of matches.
