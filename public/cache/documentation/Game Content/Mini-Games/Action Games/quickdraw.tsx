	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nQuickdraw is a mini-game in Top Dog, described as a \"western duel\" type game where the player who reacts first wins. It involves a display key and input reaction.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n\r\nQuickdraw consists of a round system to prevent the game from ending too quickly. It involves players being placed head to head, where they must press a key first to win, proceeding in a tournament style from a pool of players.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n- A 'western duel' gameplay type focused on reaction time.\r\n- Round type system to extend gameplay duration.\r\n\r\n## Art & Animation\r\n\r\n- Character-specific animations reflect personalities during the standoff, with unique stances and draw styles.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Character animations: `GAME FILE LINK: Animations/DougModelReal`\r\n- Quickdraw specific assets: `GAME FILE LINK: Minigames/Quickdraw`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n\"Each character's quickdraw animation should reflect their personality. Example: Doug's confident cowboy vs. Antony's jittery bug draw style.\" - Animation Lead, `GAME FILE LINK: Animations/DougModelReal`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nQuickdraw:\r\n\r\n-   Quickdraw\r\n\r\n    -   \\\"western duel\\\" type\r\n\r\n    -   whoever reacts first wins\r\n\r\n    -   display a key you press and whoever inputs it first wins\r\n\r\n    -   round type system to avoid it being over too fast\r\n\r\n    -   There was an image here showing the gameplay of Quickdraw.
