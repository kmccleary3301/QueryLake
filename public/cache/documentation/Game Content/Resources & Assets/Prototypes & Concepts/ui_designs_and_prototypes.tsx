	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nUser Interface (UI) design in \"Top Dog\" is integral for player interaction with the game, encompassing elements such as the main menu, in-game HUDs, and item shops. UI prototyping is performed to refine these components ensuring clarity, aesthetic consistency, and functionality.\r\n\r\n## UI Elements\r\n\r\n### Main Menu\r\nThe Main Menu is the entry point to the game, leading to various modes and settings. \r\n\r\n### In-Game HUD\r\nIn-game HUD presents essential information like scores and item inventories without obstructing gameplay.\r\n\r\n### Item Shop\r\nItem Shops facilitate the purchase of game items, with UI highlighting item costs and benefits.\r\n\r\n### Board Specific UI\r\nUnique UI elements for each game board support the thematic elements and core mechanics specific to that board.\r\n\r\n## Prototyping Process\r\n\r\nThe iterative prototyping involves designers, artists, and programmers collaborating to merge functionality, aesthetics, and user experience based on feedback from internal testing.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: UI Designs and Prototypes for \"Top Dog\"`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Main Menu Prototypes`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Character Selection UI Mockups`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Item Shop UI Design Prototype`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Board Specific UI Prototypes`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Item Shop Mechanic`\r\n- [[Game Modes]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Board Features`\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n*Images sourced from internal development documentation.

The only thing we really have to do\r\n        to complete the loop is implement the minigame roulette and\r\n        switch back and forth between the minigame and board.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Assets`(#minigame-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Time Estimates:`(#minigame-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Assets`(#character-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Time Estimates:`(#character-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shaders`(#shaders)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shader Time Estimates:`(#shader-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX`(#vfx)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX Time Estimates:`(#vfx-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Assets:`(#ui-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Out of game:`(#out-of-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: In Game:`(#in-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Asset Time Estimates:`(#ui-asset-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Assets:`(#workshop-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Workshop Template Time\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n### Story: \r\n\r\n> Since players in this game are playing in a \"gameshow\" or \"play,\" this\r\n> map takes a meta approach by starting on the stage the players are\r\n> acting on.
