	"content": "## Overview\r\nPrototype videos are used for visualizing gameplay concepts early in development. They are critical for playtesting and feedback gathering and can be used within the \"Top Dog\" development process for showcasing minigame concepts, character animations, and board gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Videos and Content\r\nThe following contents have been recorded as part of \"Top Dog\" prototype videos:\r\n- **Character Animations**: Videos showcasing character movements like Doug on a prototype map (e.g., \"Top-dog-animation-test.mp4\" featuring the Zelda map).`GAME FILE LINK: image1.png`\r\n- **Board Gameplay**: Concept videos that display prototype maps provide guidance for layout and thematic elements. However, no specific name given to these prototypes aligns with the source materials.\r\n- **Minigame Prototypes**: Specific minigame videos are not mentioned in the sources, so they are omitted here.\r\n\r\n## Relevance and Usage\r\nPrototype videos aid in internal team communication, decision-making, and external stakeholder showcases. Feedback from these videos informs gameplay design adjustments and development iterations.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\nRelevant folders for prototype videos in the development directory are included, but the exact path is not provided by the sources.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Art & Animation]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigames`\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nPrototype videos should focus on clear demonstrations of the core gameplay loop and the distinct game modes or mechanics and how they may interact. Feedback from video showcases is instrumental for further game development.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n![image12.png](image12.png)\r\n\r\n**Character Selection (With\r\nExamples)**![image1.png](image1.png)\r\n\r\n![image5.png](image5.png)\r\n\r\n### Prototype Videos \r\n\r\n\\\"Top-dog-animation-test.mp4\\\" is a video showcasing Doug with\r\nanimations moving across the Zelda map.\r\n\r\n\\\"Witch\\'s Hut.mov\\\" is a video showcasing the Witch\\'s Hut in action on\r\nthe Zelda prototype map\r\n\r\n## Music \r\n\r\n\\\"Wonderful6.m4a\\\" is a music file written by Danny\\'s friend for a\r\npotential song theme for the game\r\n\r\n## Budget & Schedule. \r\n\r\nThis is a document we made to try and think about how long and costly\r\nmaking a Kickstarter trailer would be.\r\n\r\nGriffin Games Budget & Schedule\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nThey are all unique and colorful characters.\r\n\r\n\"Tricky quests\" -\\> \"perilous obstacles\"\r\n\r\n\"Reach the finish line\" -\\> \"become the Top Dog\" - Lex\r\n\r\nTitle Graphic\r\n\r\n● Graphic here\r\n\r\nWe can get Daniel D. to sketch some designs for this.\r\n\r\nVideo Trailer\r\n\r\n● Video here\r\n\r\nGame Description Overview\r\n\r\n● Immerse yourself into the eclectic themes of Top Dog's multiverse as\r\nyou explore maps riddled with testing challenges, mysterious characters\r\nand game-changing curveballs.
