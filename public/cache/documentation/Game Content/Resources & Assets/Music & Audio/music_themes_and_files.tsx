	"content": "## Music Style and Themes\r\nThe *Top Dog* soundtrack is designed to dynamically adapt to the changing environments within the game, with a unique music track for each of the eight boards and variations for adaptive music implementation (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Adaptive Music`). Mini-game music also has unique tracks with variations to maintain the adaptive nature of the game audio ([[Mini-Games]]). Character-specific themes are crafted to enhance the personality and story of each character ([[Playable Characters]]).\r\n\r\n## Music File Structure\r\nMusic files are organized and categorized by board, mini-game, or character theme. High-quality audio formats are used to ensure sound fidelity and a seamless loop for extended play. The file structure enables easy integration and updates within the game's audio system.\r\n\r\n## Development and Collaboration\r\nThe game's music is created through collaboration between in-house composers and external music partners, with ideation and rough drafts being part of the process. Music is adapted through various stages to fit the game’s thematic goals.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Music/Enchanted_Forest/Forrest_Music_Demo_1.wav`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Music/Space_Station/Outer_Space_Ambiance.wav`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Music/Characters/Doug/Doug_Theme_V1.wav`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Theme-Specific Boards]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Danny: \"We will need a unique music track for each board, with extra time for variations of these themes.\"\r\n- Lex: \"Each character has their own set of specific tunes that will play at certain parts of the game.\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nBecause of this back and forth process, songs can take a while before\r\nthey become finalized.\r\n\r\nMusic for boards\r\n\r\n-   We will need a unique music track for each board, so 8 unique music\r\n    tracks total. **(4 weeks each track, 32 weeks total)**\r\n\r\n-   In order to implement dynamic music for these boards, we will need\r\n    some extra time to make up the variations of these themes. **(2\r\n    weeks each board, 16 weeks total)**\r\n\r\nMain theme music\r\n\r\n-   An iconic tune that is instantly recognizable as being the theme for\r\n    Top Dog. **(6 weeks)**\r\n\r\nMinigame Guide music\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n\\### Music\r\n\r\n\\- On 4/23/22, Lex and Sammi suggested some music inspirations like\r\nTycho.

For example, if you exit a village and enter a creepy forest, the\r\nmusic will change to something a bit more ominous sounding. We like to\r\nthink of adaptive music as a way of creating an immersive and cinematic\r\nexperience for the player.\r\n\r\nCharacter Themes\r\n\r\nTo help the characters stand out a little more, each character has their\r\nown set of specific tunes that will play at certain parts of the game.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nMinigame Guide music\r\n\r\n-   A song that plays when you\\'re reading how to play a minigame. **(3\r\n    weeks)**\r\n\r\nMinigame music\r\n\r\n-   There will be (8?) unique songs for minigames. **(3 weeks each song,\r\n    24 weeks total)**\r\n\r\n-   There will need to be variations of each of these songs to implement\r\n    adaptive music. **(1 week each song, 8 weeks total)**.\r\n\r\nMisc. music\r\n\r\n1.
