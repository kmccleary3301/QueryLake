	"content": "Promotional art for \"Top Dog\" includes materials for advertising, social media presence, and overall branding of the game. These encompass character art, environment art, game logo variations, and game-related animations.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe promotional art package provides assets for various promotional channels and supports branding consistency throughout the game's presence in the market.\n\n## Art & Assets\n\nCharacter renders, like \"[Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug)\" in alternative color schemes such as \"`GAME FILE LINK: ClubClubDogAlt1.png`\", highlight the customizability in the game. High-resolution images like \"`GAME FILE LINK: DougModelLineupHD.png`\" detail character design to foster community attachment.\n\nEnvironment art, including concepts of various settings like the Enchanted Forest and Space Station, and their mood boards, contribute to the immersive world-building of \"Top Dog\", displayed in assets like \"`GAME FILE LINK: Space Station Concept Art`\".\n\nAnimations, involving character motions such as idles, and dynamic elements of the game logo, help in creating an engaging and lively portrayal of \"Top Dog\".\n\n## Marketing Use\n\nMarketing materials incorporate these artworks, particularly in trailers and social media. Character emoticons create a cultural presence beyond the game, as seen in emoticons designed for Discord communication. \n\nBehind-the-scenes content like timelapses of character art development provides insight into the game's creation, nurturing a transparent and involved community relationship.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n- <|Characters/Playable Characters/*|\n- <|Social Media/Art Time Lapses/*|\n- <|Animations/DougModelReal/*|\n- <|Logo/Logo Vectorization Mockup.psd|\n\n## See Also\n- [[Characters]]\n- [[Art & Animation]]\n- [[Marketing Materials]]\n- [[Game Modes]]\n\n## Developer Notes\n- The artwork adapts to the promotional platform's context, such as highlighting the story or gameplay elements.\n\nPromotional art shapes the initial impressions and continues to convey the game's personality and offerings to the community.\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\nThere are 4 images showcasing possible Griffin Games logos, each\nprogressing to a more specific logo idea\n\nThere is a section for Concept Art images and videos, including but not\nlimited to: Early concepts for characters and the Enchanted Forest, art\nfor the critters that could appear in the world of Top Dog, rigging\nvideos for the character animations, Top Dog logo art, Host character\nand antagonist character art including the early concept art for Phil,\nand some shopkeeper art.\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n-   Stage 5: Art Pass 3/Testing\n\n    -   Final art pass to iron out issues and art changes discovered in\n        the QA phase and then tested before being sent back to QA.\n\n-   Stage 6: Finalization\n\n    -   Go through and add the final bit of polish, make sure everything\n        is laid out properly and address any problems generated by art\n        pass 2/ Quality Assurance feedback\n\n#### Map Assets \n\n-   8 Maps [10 are currently in the information doc, but 8 is our\n    target]\n\n    -   Fully Modeled base environment\n\n    -   Large Detail Props (Trees, buildings)\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n-   Stage 2: Art Pass 1\n\n    -   Once the layout is determined and the map has undergone thorough\n        feedback testing, basic art is applied (think texturing and\n        major props), good to playtest at this point for readability\n\n    -   (Daniel2) This is when we can experiment with the donated props\n        being provided to us, and see how they look by default. Only\n        basic shading will be used here, as that's later in the art\n        pass.\n\n-   Stage 3: Art Pass 2\n```\n\n#### Source 4\n```text\n\\- Mushroom creature\n\n\\- Tree creature\n\n\\# Art & Animation\n\n\\## Concept Art\n\n\\- Shopkeepers\n\n\\- Host\n\n\\- Monster characters\n\n\\- Enchanted forest environments\n\n\\## Character Art\n\n\\- 2D character sprites\n\n\\- 3D character models\n\n\\- Animations\n\n\\## Environment Art\n\n\\- 3D environments for Enchanted Forest board\n\n\\- 3D environments for minigame arenas\n\n\\- Props\n\n\\# Music & Audio\n\n\\- Looking for music partners\n\n\\- Discussed deals with Jack and SMLE (electronic artist duo)\n\n\\- Sound effects\n\n\\- Voice acting\n\n\\# Gameplay\n\n\\## Enchanted Forest Board\n\n\\- Main board game component with multiple paths\n```\n\n#### Source 5\n```text\n##### Minigame Time Estimates: \n\n-   Blocking out/Testing -\n\n-   Art Pass 1/Testing -\n\n-   Art Pass 2/Testing -\n\n-   Quality Assurance -\n\n-   Art Pass 3/Testing -\n\n-   Finalization -\n\nTo Daniel: Minigames are a different beast than maps so feel free to\nre-draft the steps required for art passes if you'd like, adding less or\nmore.\n\n#### Character Assets \n\n-   10 Characters\n\n    -   Palette Swap Alternates\n\n    -   More Complex alternates (if we do some kind of skin/battle pass\n        idea)\n\n-   Animations for all characters\n\n##### Character Time Estimates: \n\n#### Shaders\n```\n\n#### Source 6\n```text\n\\- Announcements and events\n\n\\- Holiday/topical posts\n\n\\- Milestones and achievements\n\n\\- Gifs and short video clips\n\nExecutive Suite\n\nHere are my detailed notes on the relevant information from the chat\nlog:\n\n\\# Game Concept\n\n\\- Multiplayer party game with minigames and a board game component\n\n\\- Set in an enchanted forest with mystical characters\n\n\\## Other Characters\n\n\\- Shopkeepers (concept art done but unnamed)\n\n\\- Host character (concept art done but unnamed)\n\n\\- Monster characters\n\n\\- Mushroom creature\n\n\\- Tree creature\n\n\\# Art & Animation\n\n\\## Concept Art\n\n\\- Shopkeepers\n\n\\- Host\n```\n\n#### Source 7\n```text\nThis is a spreadsheet for all of our items.\n\n### Zoom meeting discussing items \n\n\\\"Item Meeting 8_26_2022.mp4\\\"\n\n## Characters \n\n### Playable Character Art \n\nThese are art assets for the following characters:\n\nDoug\n\nFox\n\nFinn\n\nDraco\n\nDoug\n\nDallas\n\nClyde\n\nCatherine\n\nBonnie\n\nAntony\n\n\\\"ClubClubLineupRevise.png\\\" is all the characters in a row\n\n### NPC Art \n\nOtis.PNG\n\nThis is a frog in Enchanted Forest\n\nFrog.png\n\nWitch.png\n\n\\\"Tree Critter\\\".png\n\nSpacestation_NPC_concept.png\n\nShopkeeper_owl.png\n\nShopkeeper_badger.png\n\nShopkeep_chameleon.png\n\nShopkeep_chameleon_blank.,png\n```\n\n#### Source 8\n```text\n-   Stage 3: Art Pass 2\n\n    -   Refining based on the previous step, begin adding some detail\n        props and background elements and test again, replace elements\n        that didn't work or look good in the first art pass.\n\n-   Stage 4: Quality Assurance\n\n    -   With the map mostly done, we will test the quality of the map by\n        asking our playtesters to describe what they like about the map\n        and what they dislike.\n\n-   Stage 5: Art Pass 3/Testing\n```\n\n#### Source 9\n```text\n-   Less complex 2D characters to serve as map denizens\n\n    -   Stylized material suite for background elements, likely requires\n        some detail variation as well.\n\n    -   At a bare minimum we will likely need one or more textures for\n        quite a few elements.\n\n##### Map Time Estimates [Feel free to adjust these are tentative.
