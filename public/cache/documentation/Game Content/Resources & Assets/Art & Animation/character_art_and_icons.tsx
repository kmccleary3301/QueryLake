	"content": "## Character Art Overview\r\n\r\n### Playable Characters\r\nPlayable characters feature varied designs to cater to different player aesthetics and preferences. Notable characters include *[Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug)*, *[Catherine](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/catherine)*, and *[Clyde](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/clyde)*. Characters do not specify gender and use they/them pronouns. Custom characters can be added to the game, with trailer videos showcasing them automatically generated.\r\n\r\n### Character Icons\r\nCharacter icons are consistent with the game's art style, used within the game's UI and on communication platforms such as Discord.\r\n\r\n## NPC Art\r\nNPCs enrich the game world, offering items for sale and introducing board-specific mechanics. Designs are themed to match their environments, such as shopkeepers or the critters in the *`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Enchanted Forest`*.\r\n\r\n## Animation\r\nCharacter animations are crafted to express emotions and actions, with a range of animations from idle poses to complex interactions. Animations are managed using state machines and *`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: blend trees`*.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/characters/Playable Characters`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/characters/NPCs`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/characters/Character Icons`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: animations/DougModelReal`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Non-Playable Characters]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Enchanted Forest`\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Animation Time Estimates`\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Additional skins and accessories are planned for playable characters to prioritize customization.\r\n- NPC development is underway, focusing on detailed backstories for better immersion.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\- Paulie -
