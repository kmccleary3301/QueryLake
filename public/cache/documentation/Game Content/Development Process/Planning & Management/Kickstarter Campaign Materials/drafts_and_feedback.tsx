	"content": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe drafts and feedback process is crucial for the development of \"Top Dog,\" allowing for iterative design and refinement of the player experience.\r\n\r\n## Drafting Process\r\n\r\n### Characters\r\n\r\nCharacter designs evolve through concept sketches and drafts with a focus on personality and unique animations.\r\n\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: \"Character Lineup.png\"`\r\n\r\n### Boards\r\n\r\nBoard designs, such as the [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board), involve brainstorming, drafting unique features, and aesthetics.\r\n\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: \"Enchanted Forest board.PNG\"`\r\n\r\n### Mini-Games\r\n\r\nMini-games are prototyped to refine gameplay mechanics such as strategy and precision.\r\n\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: \"Kamifusen_Console_Animat.gif\"`\r\n\r\n### Items & Power-Ups\r\n\r\nItems undergo design iterations to ensure balance and enjoyability.\r\n\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: \"Universal_Items.png\"`\r\n\r\n## Feedback Mechanisms\r\n\r\nFeedback is obtained through internal playtests and community engagement, with tools like surveys and forums employed for data collection.\r\n\r\n### Internal Playtesting\r\n\r\nInternal playtesting provides observational feedback on game mechanics.\r\n\r\n### Community Feedback Mechanisms\r\n\r\nCommunity feedback is gathered through social media, demos, and early access programs.\r\n\r\n## Revision and Implementation\r\n\r\nFeedback informs revisions, with a balance between original design intentions and player experience improvements.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Board Designs: \"`GAME FILE LINK: development/boards`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- Document feedback sessions highlighting key points for review.\r\n- Apply changes incrementally to maintain game balance.\r\n- Foster open, constructive criticism for continuous game improvement.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n2.  Rough Draft\r\n\r\n    a.  This will be a rough outline of the song and will be used to get\r\n        feedback about the general direction of the song.\r\n\r\n3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 as necessary until the team is satisfied with\r\n    the song\\'s direction.\r\n\r\n4.  Record\r\n\r\n    a.
