	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThe **General Art Process** for **Top Dog** involves creating art that supports the game's enchanted forest theme and enhances player immersion, while integrating with game mechanics.\r\n\r\n## Stages of Art Creation\r\n\r\n### Stage 1: Blocking Out\r\nThe first stage involves basic form creation, such as map layout sketching and character concept illustrations. Simple models may be tested in Blender for level flow and playability (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 8`).\r\n\r\n### Stage 2: Art Pass 1\r\nArt Pass 1 includes texturing and placing significant props after layout approval. Playtest for readability and navigation at this juncture (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 2`).\r\n\r\n### Stage 3: Art Pass 2\r\nRefinement of assets with additional details and background elements based on feedback from the previous art pass. Replace or augment unsatisfactory elements (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 9`).\r\n\r\n### Stage 4: Quality Assurance\r\nPlaytesters evaluate map and asset quality, providing feedback on areas that engage them and suggestions for improvement (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 9`).\r\n\r\n### Stage 5: Art Pass 3/Testing\r\nThe final pass addresses issues identified in QA, with further testing before sending back to QA (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 3`).\r\n\r\n### Stage 6: Finalization\r\nAdd a final touch of polish. Technical and creative standards are assured before considering assets complete (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 3`).\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- Character Concept Art: `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Concept Art/*`\r\n- Maps and Environments: `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/*` and `GAME FILE LINK: Animations/Overworld Universal/*`\r\n- Shader and Textures: `GAME FILE LINK: _Textures source files/*`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [Board and Environment Art](/docs/game_content/resources_assets/art_animation/board_and_environment_art)\r\n- [[Animation Libraries]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- \"Ensure that art assets align with adaptive music and game mode variety.\" (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 17`)\r\n- \"Pay attention to character iconicity for both marketing and in-game identification.\" (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 15`)\r\n- \"Consider post-launch content during asset creation for easier extension integration.\" (`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: source 14`)\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nThere are 4 images showcasing possible Griffin Games logos, each\r\nprogressing to a more specific logo idea\r\n\r\nThere is a section for Concept Art images and videos, including but not\r\nlimited to: Early concepts for characters and the Enchanted Forest, art\r\nfor the critters that could appear in the world of Top Dog, rigging\r\nvideos for the character animations, Top Dog logo art, Host character\r\nand antagonist character art including the early concept art for Phil,\r\nand some shopkeeper art.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n-   Stage 2: Art Pass 1\r\n\r\n    -   Once the layout is determined and the map has undergone thorough\r\n        feedback testing, basic art is applied (think texturing and\r\n        major props), good to playtest at this point for readability\r\n\r\n    -   (Daniel2) This is when we can experiment with the donated props\r\n        being provided to us, and see how they look by default.
