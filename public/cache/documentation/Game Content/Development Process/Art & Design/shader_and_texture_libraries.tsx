	"content": "Top Dog integrates an extensive library of shaders and textures that provide distinct visual styles and enhance the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\n## Shader Overview\r\n\r\nThe shader library within Top Dog includes a variety of custom shaders designed to achieve specific visual effects. Key shaders used in the game are:\r\n\r\n- **Water Shader**: The Water Shader is important for creating dynamic water surfaces. This shader simulates the movement and reflectivity of water. ``GAME FILE LINK: image4.png``\r\n\r\n- **Splat Map Shader**: Allows multiple textures to blend seamlessly on a single mesh, for natural transitions between different terrain types like cobblestone, grass, and dirt. ``GAME FILE LINK: image6.png``\r\n\r\n## Texture Libraries\r\n\r\nTextures in Top Dog are crafted to complement the game's art direction, contributing to the unique look and feel of each board and character.\r\n\r\n- **Mushroom Cap and Bark Textures**: Specialty textures for the Enchanted Forest board.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Game Content\r\n\r\nShaders and textures are integral to character and map asset creation.\r\n\r\n## Challenges and Considerations\r\n\r\nThe development of shaders and textures requires consideration of game performance, platform limitations, and artistic direction.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Boards\\_Textures source files``\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Enchanted Forest``\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Space Station``\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Art & Animation]]\r\n- [[Programming & Coding]]\r\n\r\n### Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- Artistic experimentation is encouraged within the team to discover new visual effects that can be achieved using the existing library of shaders and textures.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n-   Animations for all characters\r\n\r\n##### Character Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n#### Shaders \r\n\r\n-   We will likely need a couple basic shaders for representing game\r\n    elements\r\n\r\n-   A basic fresnel shader or masked emission shader for highlighting\r\n    map elements\r\n\r\n-   ![image4.png](image4.png){width=\"3.1718755468066493in\"\r\n    height=\"1.0572922134733158in\"}\r\n\r\n-   Water will need its own shader\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Assets`(#minigame-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Time Estimates:`(#minigame-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Assets`(#character-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Time Estimates:`(#character-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shaders`(#shaders)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shader Time Estimates:`(#shader-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX`(#vfx)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX Time Estimates:`(#vfx-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Assets:`(#ui-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Out of game:`(#out-of-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: In Game:`(#in-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Asset Time Estimates:`(#ui-asset-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Assets:`(#workshop-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Workshop Template Time\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n-   Water will need its own shader\r\n\r\n-   It may be worth developing a custom toon style shader to represent\r\n    background elements (as opposed to trying to do things in a\r\n    `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: PBR`(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering)\r\n    or exclusively Unlit workflow) though this depends on artist input\r\n\r\n-   Splat map shader to properly apply terrain variation to a static\r\n    mesh (notice the different materials (cobblestone, grass, and dirt)\r\n    fading in and out\r\n\r\n-   ![image6.png](image6.png){width=\"6.267716535433071in\"\r\n    height=\"0.8611111111111112in\"}\r\n\r\n-   Possible foliage shader\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n-   ![image6.png](image6.png){width=\"6.267716535433071in\"\r\n    height=\"0.8611111111111112in\"}\r\n\r\n-   Possible foliage shader\r\n\r\n-   Possible fire/lava shader\r\n\r\n##### Shader Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n##### VFX \r\n\r\n-   Particles to add dynamic information\r\n\r\n-   Particles for various events\r\n\r\n-   Stars/Sparks/Halos for dice rolling and all kinds of stuff\r\n\r\n##### VFX Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n#### UI Assets: \r\n\r\n##### Out of game: \r\n\r\n-   Main Menu\r\n\r\n-   Options Menu\r\n\r\n-   Load Screen\r\n\r\n-   Multiplayer menu (with options for different modes)\r\n\r\n    -
