	"content": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nCharacter and map asset creation is a crucial aspect of the video game development process in \"Top Dog\". This document provides an overview of building these components.\r\n\r\n## Character Asset Creation\r\n\r\n### Playable Characters\r\n\r\nPlayable characters like [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug) and [Catherine](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/catherine), are central to \"Top Dog,\" with each character designed to be gender-neutral using they/them pronouns. Characters such as [Paulie](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/paulie) and [Clyde](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/clyde) are integral to the game's world.\r\n\r\n#### Skins and Variants\r\n\r\nA variety of skins and variants allow for character customization, with both palette swaps and more complex alternates being available. Alternate costumes can also be created and added to the game.\r\n\r\n#### Animations\r\n\r\nCharacters are given a range of animations to reflect their actions within the game. Detailed animations along with state machines ensure smooth transitions.\r\n\r\n### Non-Playable Characters\r\n\r\nNPCs including shopkeepers and other characters like the [Host Character](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/host_character) contribute to the \"Top Dog\" world. Their animations are limited to fulfilling specific in-game tasks.\r\n\r\n## Map Asset Creation\r\n\r\n### General Map Features\r\n\r\nEach game board possesses unique features and themes, with boards exhibiting features like the [Wetworld Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/wetworld_board) or [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board). \r\n\r\n#### Art and Texture Design\r\n\r\nArt assets, including 3D models and texture libraries, are created to scaffold the game boards. Shaders like vertex color and outline shaders play a role in achieving the desired visual effects.\r\n\r\n#### Environment Animation\r\n\r\nMap assets are enhanced with environmental animations like foliage and water movements using shaders and animations to add realism.\r\n\r\n### Specific Board Features\r\n\r\nBoards are designed with unique gimmicks and identity, undergoing various stages from prototyping to final QA. For instance, Doug's map may be set at a baseball stadium to reflect his backstory. \r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/DougModelReal`\r\n\r\n## Development Notes\r\n\r\n- Consistency with the game's thematic style is imperative in asset creation.\r\n- The game's art methodology may require adjustments based on asset types; characters and maps will likely have different art process requirements.\r\n- Collaboration between art, design, and programming teams is critical.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Assets`(#minigame-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Time Estimates:`(#minigame-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Assets`(#character-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Time Estimates:`(#character-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shaders`(#shaders)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shader Time Estimates:`(#shader-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX`(#vfx)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX Time Estimates:`(#vfx-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Assets:`(#ui-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Out of game:`(#out-of-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: In Game:`(#in-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Asset Time Estimates:`(#ui-asset-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Assets:`(#workshop-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Workshop Template Time\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n\\- Paulie - Food reviewer character\r\n\r\n\\- Clyde - Bounty hunter character\r\n\r\n\\### Custom Characters\r\n\r\n\\- Custom characters can be created and added to the game\r\n\r\n\\- Custom characters should have automatically generated trailer videos\r\nshowcasing them\r\n\r\n\\### Character Gender\r\n\r\n\\- Character bios do not specify gender\r\n\r\n\\- Use they/them pronouns for all characters\r\n\r\n\\### Character Items\r\n\r\n\\- Ideas for unique items for each character\r\n\r\n\\- Concerns raised about limiting powerful items to certain characters\r\n\r\n\\- Suggestion to have \\\"chosen items\\\" that any character can select\r\n\r\n\\## World/Setting\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: General Process:`(#general-process)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Map Assets`(#map-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Map Time Estimates [Feel free to adjust these are tentative.
