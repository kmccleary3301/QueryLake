Have the player act out their turn as normal, and if they didn't\r\n        use an item yet, let them choose to use the declaration after\r\n        this turn's roll for the next turn.

The way it drops and you\r\n            pick it up would fall to the strength of the mechanic, but\r\n            the acorns take up an item slot. Players can then go down to\r\n            what is currently the high tier item shop and (maybe) pay a\r\n            small fee to open it like a loot box. The acorn could\r\n            include various items, but should be the only way to get\r\n            your character item.
