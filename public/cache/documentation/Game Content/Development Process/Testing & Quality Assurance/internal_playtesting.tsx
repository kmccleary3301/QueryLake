	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nInternal Playtesting is a process to evaluate the game \"Top Dog\" focusing on design, mechanics, and stability. The goal is to enhance player experience by identifying flaws and areas of improvement.\r\n\r\n## Playtesting Goals\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that characters such as [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug) perform as intended, offering a balanced gameplay experience.\r\n\r\n2. Evaluate each mini-game for engagement and replayability.\r\n\r\n3. Assess items and power-ups on game progression and player strategy.\r\n\r\n4. Fine-tune the boards, ensuring events and mechanics enhance thematic immersion without disrupting balance.\r\n\r\n5. Observe the game's resource management, including currency distribution and usage.\r\n\r\n6. Confirm that the game's music and audio contribute positively to the game's ambiance and pacing.\r\n\r\n7. Test the network reliability in multiplayer modes to ensure a smooth experience.\r\n\r\n8. Ensure stability across all planned features, using the test build coverage.\r\n\r\n## Playtesting Process\r\n\r\n1. Structured play sessions document any bugs or design inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n2. Specific focus-group testing for individual characters and mini-games examines entertainment value and UI clarity.\r\n\r\n3. Balance testing evaluates the fairness of items and mechanics.\r\n\r\n4. Systematic examination of boards to ensure gameplay dynamics align with the creative vision.\r\n\r\n5. Constant revision of characters to maintain uniqueness and fun factor.\r\n\r\n6. Ongoing iterations to improve the game's core loop informed by internal tester inputs.\r\n\r\n## Reporting and Feedback\r\n\r\nPlaytesting findings are compiled and reviewed during [[Development Process]] meetings. Insights are prioritized and addressed regarding their impact on the game's quality and timeline.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n\"We need to streamline our playtesting process to focus on specific mechanics each week. We can't keep doing general playtests and expect to hit our Q4 internal review target.\" - Producer\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n3.  Develop each specific minigame (Targeted amount of minigames\r\n    unknown) to implement the framework alongside its unique assets and\r\n    mechanics.

This can be as\r\n        simple as a series of blocks from blender or just the layout. It\r\n        can even be done in an analogue way with pen and paper if\r\n        necessary.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n-   Stage 2: Art Pass 1\r\n\r\n    -   Once the layout is determined and the map has undergone thorough\r\n        feedback testing, basic art is applied (think texturing and\r\n        major props), good to playtest at this point for readability\r\n\r\n    -   (Daniel2) This is when we can experiment with the donated props\r\n        being provided to us, and see how they look by default. Only\r\n        basic shading will be used here, as that's later in the art\r\n        pass.\r\n\r\n-   Stage 3: Art Pass 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n-   Stage 3: Art Pass 2\r\n\r\n    -   Refining based on the previous step, begin adding some detail\r\n        props and background elements and test again, replace elements\r\n        that didn't work or look good in the first art pass.\r\n\r\n-   Stage 4: Quality Assurance\r\n\r\n    -   With the map mostly done, we will test the quality of the map by\r\n        asking our playtesters to describe what they like about the map\r\n        and what they dislike.\r\n\r\n-   Stage 5: Art Pass 3/Testing\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\n# Character Items \r\n\r\n## Doug's Bone Map: \r\n\r\n1)  [It should definitely give a golden bone, but should it give extra\r\n    things? If so, what? Items/coins? This may be something to balance\r\n    as we playtest.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Catherine's Gamer Rage: \r\n\r\n1)  By what factor should the roll grow? I could see it being your place\r\n    as a factor, aka 1 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, etc.\r\n\r\n2)  Should the steal be random (50/50) between coins and items? How many\r\n    coins should a player steal?\r\n\r\n## Clyde's Trap Explosion:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\n\\- Menus styled as backstage rooms\r\n\r\n\\- Dice roll animations\r\n\r\n\\- Gashapon capsule animations\r\n\r\n\\### Characters\r\n\r\n\\- Gender neutral animal characters\r\n\r\n\\- Custom characters\r\n\r\n\\### Music\r\n\r\n\\- Adaptive music changes based on location\r\n\r\n\\- Music inspired by Mario Party soundtracks\r\n\r\n\\### Art Style\r\n\r\n\\- Anthropomorphic animal characters\r\n\r\n\\## Development\r\n\r\n\\### Platforms\r\n\r\n\\- Primarily PC with controller support\r\n\r\n\\- Use WASD keyboard buttons displayed in prompts\r\n\r\n\\### Testing\r\n\r\n\\- Find experienced playtesters\r\n\r\n\\- Seek out YouTubers/streamers\r\n\r\nHere are my detailed notes on the game development chat log:\r\n```"
