	"content": "Balance and Gameplay Adjustments ensure \"Top Dog\" provides a fun experience for players. The process involves balancing character abilities, items, mini-games, and board events to create fair play and maintain appeal.\r\n\r\n## Character Balance\r\n\r\nPlayable characters like [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug), [Catherine](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/catherine), have unique abilities that influence the gameplay. Continuous playtesting and data analytics are utilized for adjustments.\r\n\r\n## Item Adjustment\r\n\r\nItems such as [Piggy Bank](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/piggy_bank), [Declaration Die](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/declaration_die), and board-specific items are scrutinized for their impact on gameplay. Adjustments are made to maintain balance.\r\n\r\n## Mini-Game Adjustments\r\n\r\nMini-games undergo testing to ensure a mix of challenge types. The team collects community feedback to refine mini-game mechanics.\r\n\r\n## Board Events and Mechanics\r\n\r\nBoards like the [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board) feature specific events. Adjustments are made to map-specific events and gimmicks to ensure a balanced experience.\r\n\r\n## Patch Notes and Community Feedback\r\n\r\nCommunication with players through patch notes and active engagement in forums like the game's `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Discord` server influences balance decisions.\r\n\r\n## Developer Tools\r\n\r\nDeveloper tools and logs enable thorough testing of game states for streamlining balance adjustments.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/DougModelReal/*`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/*`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Enchanted Forest/Board Concept/*`\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n### Developer Notes\r\n- Increase the cost and reduce the frequency of character-specific items for balance.\r\n- Proposed changes to enhance the appeal of less popular universal items.\r\n- Calling for differentiated challenge levels in mini-games to cater to various player skill sets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Accurate documentation is vital for the internal process, ensuring the successful evolution of Top Dogâ€™s gameplay.**\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\- Can fill trailer length without sacrificing quality\r\n\r\n\\- Analysis of successful Kickstarter trailers often include commentary\r\n\r\n\\- Arguments against commentary:\r\n\r\n\\- Gameplay should sell itself without explanation\r\n\r\n\\- Commentary may come across as too \\\"corporate\\\"\r\n\r\n\\- Focus should be on showing not telling\r\n\r\n\\- Majority of team leaned against commentary\r\n\r\n\\- General agreement that showing gameplay should take priority over\r\ncommentary\r\n\r\n\\- Suggestion to have multiple trailers - one pure gameplay, one with\r\ncommentary\r\n\r\n\\- Suggestion to end gameplay trailer with brief commentary/words from\r\ndevs\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n\\# Relevant Examples\r\n\r\n\\- Shovel Knight and Friday Night Funkin\\' successful gameplay-focused\r\ntrailers\r\n\r\n\\- Political Arena mixed commentary and gameplay well\r\n\r\n\\# Production Concerns\r\n\r\n\\- Need enough gameplay footage for cohesive trailer\r\n\r\n\\- Commentary can help fill space if gameplay lacking\r\n\r\n\\- Intro animation scope/feasibility\r\n\r\nHere are detailed notes from the chat export, organized into relevant\r\ncategories and subcategories:\r\n\r\n\\# Map Design\r\n\r\n\\## Overview\r\n\r\n\\- Enchanted forest theme\r\n\r\n\\- Vertical layout, climbs up a large tree\r\n\r\n\\- Risk/reward system with path choices\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n\\- Suggestion to end gameplay trailer with brief commentary/words from\r\ndevs\r\n\r\n\\## Trailer Outline\r\n\r\n\\- Shini put together rough outline and timeline for trailer\r\n\r\n\\- Intro animation\r\n\r\n\\- Character select screen\r\n\r\n\\- Gameplay sequences showing board, minigames, items, abilities\r\n\r\n\\- Community involvement\r\n\r\n\\- Future plans\r\n\r\n\\- Call to action\r\n\r\n\\## Music Direction\r\n\r\n\\- Shini working on music outline to match trailer pace\r\n\r\n\\- Music should highlight fun and excitement\r\n\r\n\\## Target Audience\r\n\r\n\\- Backers that will donate at \\\"own the game\\\" tier or higher are main\r\npriority\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: General Process:`(#general-process)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Map Assets`(#map-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Map Time Estimates [Feel free to adjust these are tentative.

In my simulation currently, pretty much all items can be in\r\n    shops or obtained through orb spaces at equally random rates, which\r\n    can cause some balance problems such as some players getting a 5\r\n    cost double dice while others get a 20 cost teleporter.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 10\r\n```text\r\n2)  As a follow up to 1, Consider this video at timestamp 15:07\r\n    `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ZSCwohL84`(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ZSCwohL84)\r\n    where, in some mario parties, including 6, they had item tables to\r\n    determine what items appeared in shops, at orb spaces, including\r\n    only a very specific number of items in each board, etc. In short,\r\n    is there a comprehensive way to evaluate how we distribute items so\r\n    that it is balanced for all players?\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 11\r\n```text\r\n# Universal \r\n\r\n## Wish bone: \r\n\r\nbreak it in half, get a chance to get extra coins after each task\r\n\r\n## [Wet Fish:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[characters can\\'t land on same space who got slapped or pass\r\nthem]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[last 1 turn]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[can be used on self or others]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Shop Ticket:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Discount on next item you buy (50%, more or less depends on\r\nbalance)]{.mark}\r\n\r\n-   [Only appears in random orb spaces, can't buy in shop]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Game Chooser]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Pick 2v2, FFA, 1v3, etc or choose 1 from a random 5]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Roll Booster \r\n\r\nCan roll higher than highest allowed value for a few turns\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 12\r\n```text\r\n> The main function of the map is the clock hands, both of which can be\r\n> controlled by the player at specific spots (undecided where, but\r\n> likely at spots outside the outer ring so they aren't used that\r\n> frequently) on the map.

A point of contention which I am sure we have all worried\r\n            about is the size of the players in relation to the board.\r\n            We probably need to import some version of the board to\r\n            unity ASAP so we can see the scale first hand and make\r\n            adjustments if needed.\r\n\r\n        2.
