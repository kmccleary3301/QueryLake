	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThe board logic facilitates player interaction with the game board, handles movement, item effects, event triggers, and transitions to minigames after each round.\r\n\r\n## Mechanics\r\n\r\nPlayers roll a die to determine movement around the board, with various types of spaces affecting in-game resources.\r\n\r\n## Item Interactions\r\n\r\nItems affect player's chances of winning by influencing stats or altering the board state. A system checks conditions to determine item eligibility and contextual effects.\r\n\r\n## Phases and Events\r\n\r\nTurns are divided into phases with the possibility for some items to sequence break these phases. Board-specific events can also be triggered.\r\n\r\n## Minigame Integration\r\n\r\nA UML-diagrammed framework selects a minigame ensuring variety and thematic consistency.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Board and logic scripts: `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Board Ideas.gdoc`\r\n- Space icons and functionality: `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Universal Board Icons/Sprite Sheet.png`\r\n- Themed board elements:\r\n  - Enchanted Forest events: `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Enchanted Forest/Board Concept/Untitled (1).json`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n- [[Theme-Specific Boards]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [Mini-Game Logic](/docs/game_content/development_process/programming_coding/minigame_logic)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure items integrate with movement to avoid static strategies - Game Designer\r\n- Modular event trigger system for new events - Lead Programmer\r\n- Balance and flow of trap items require close monitoring - Quality Assurance Lead\r\n- Investigate performance optimizations for larger maps - Performance Analyst\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Tech / Programming`(#tech-programming)\r\n\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Board logic`(#board-logic)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame logic`(#minigame-logic)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Menus:`(#menus)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Out of game:`(#out-of-game)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: In Game:`(#in-game)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: MiniGame Frenzy`(#minigame-frenzy)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Support:`(#workshop-support)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Networking/Multiplayer:`(#networkingmultiplayer)\r\n\r\n`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Art`(#art)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Music`(#music-1)\r\n\r\n### **Tech / Programming** \r\n\r\n#### Board logic \r\n\r\n1.
