Of course, these ideas are more focused on what could be a\r\n            single player experience. I imagine in multiplayer, the\r\n            story is left alone and players just play the map without\r\n            the background stuff. But I feel that designing maps this\r\n            way can really help ground the cast and show why they play\r\n            the game show.
