	"content": "Social media serves as a key communication channel for video game developers to engage with their audience, build community, and promote their titles. For \"Top Dog,\" leveraging various social platforms is pivotal for building awareness and fostering player engagement.\r\n\r\n## Twitter\r\nTwitter is the primary platform for sharing updates with posts character bios and concept art. Tweets are scheduled once per week during peak interaction times which are 8am, 2pm, 4pm, and 8:30pm.\r\n\r\n## Instagram\r\nInstagram serves as a secondary focus with its content mirroring that on Twitter. Instagram requires connection to Facebook for Buffer to post automatically; manual posting is in effect until the Facebook account linkage is resolved.\r\n\r\n## Discord\r\nA Discord server has been set up to nurture a dedicated community around \"Top Dog.\" Features are being finalized before broad promotion.\r\n\r\n## LinkedIn\r\nThe LinkedIn presence is minimal with plans for an introductory post about the project.\r\n\r\n## YouTube\r\nA YouTube channel is under consideration to host trailers and development diaries.\r\n\r\n## Social Media Strategy\r\nThe strategy is focused on professionalism, high-quality content, and audience engagement. Unfinished assets are not posted, and engagement with commenters and followers is important. Peak times are utilized to maximize views, and cross-promotion across platforms is practiced. Files are compressed before posting to respect size limits, and metrics and performance are analyzed to adjust strategy.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Art & Animation]]\r\n- [[Marketing Materials]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Twitter follower goal is under reassessment to enhance outreach initiatives.\r\n- Efforts to streamline Instagram content scheduling are underway.\r\n- LinkedIn and YouTube strategies need additional development resources.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\# Meeting Notes\r\n\r\n\\- Regular meetings to review progress\r\n\r\n\\- Provided feedback on blockout, textures, modeling\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed ideas for events, environments, aesthetics\r\n\r\n\\- Planned content direction and task prioritization\r\n\r\n\\- Coordinated importing Blender scene into Unity\r\n\r\n\\- Shared progress for community updates\r\n\r\n\\- Brainstormed solutions for lighting, foliage, paths\r\n\r\n\\- Reviewed concept art and offered critiques\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed roles, workflows, pipelines\r\n\r\nMarketing\r\n\r\n\\# Social Media Platforms\r\n\r\n\\## Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Main social media focus currently\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nMarketing\r\n\r\n\\# Social Media Platforms\r\n\r\n\\## Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Main social media focus currently\r\n\r\n\\- Goal was 200 followers by end of June 2022 but fell short\r\n\r\n\\- Currently has 129 followers as of April 2022\r\n\r\n\\- Posts character bios and concept art\r\n\r\n\\- Tweets scheduled once per week\r\n\r\n\\- Peak interaction times: 8am, 2pm, 4pm, 8:30pm\r\n\r\n\\## Instagram\r\n\r\n\\- Secondary focus\r\n\r\n\\- Currently has fewer followers than Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Posts same content as Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Instagram requires connection to Facebook for Buffer to post\r\nautomatically\r\n\r\n\\- Manually posting for now until Facebook account connected\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nPaulie is an avid traveler and a huge foodie.
