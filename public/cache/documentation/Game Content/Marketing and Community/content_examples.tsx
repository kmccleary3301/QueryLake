They include characters, boards, mini-games, and documentation of the game's universe.\r\n\r\n## Characters\r\nThe cast of \"Top Dog\" includes anthropomorphic animals like \"[Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug),\" a baseball star, and \"[Catherine](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/catherine),\" a competitive streamer. Each character may have unique items impacting gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Boards\r\nBoards in \"Top Dog\" offer varying challenges. Themed boards such as the \"Enchanted Forest\" feature events and items unique to their environment.\r\n\r\n## Mini-Games\r\n\"Top Dog\" includes categories of mini-games, such as \"[[Strategy Games]]\" and \"[[Action Games]],\" which are essential for varied gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nThe development team emphasizes detailed content creation, playtesting, and community feedback to refine the game.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/DougModelReal`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Wetworld`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Mini-games/ClubClubLineupRevise.png`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n##### UI Asset Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n#### Workshop Assets: \r\n\r\n-   1 Example \"workshop character\" a good template designed for\r\n    reference (most games with workshop support end up doing this, this\r\n    guy can end up being super basic though so it shouldn\\'t be very\r\n    difficult)\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop minigame\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop map\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   A system/tutorial to animate custom characters\r\n\r\n-   Done well in rivals of aether\r\n\r\n    -   `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert`(https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n-   `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert`(https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert)\r\n\r\nIf this proves to be too difficult our workshop example could be\r\nexisting content from the game\r\n\r\n##### Workshop Template Time Estimate: \r\n\r\n#### Animation: \r\n\r\n-   Organize using state machines to keep animation workflow clean\r\n    between layers, example image of using Airborne and Running state\r\n    machines to keep like animations organized\r\n\r\n![image8.png](image8.png)\r\n\r\n-   Create root motion and base animations for all playable characters\r\n    (**3-5 days per character**)\r\n\r\n    -   Walk\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nMisc. music\r\n\r\n1.

Character items are very strong, new items that deserve unique\r\n        ways of obtaining it, better than just having a high tier item\r\n        shop, which is very similar to Mario Party.

A point of contention which I am sure we have all worried\r\n            about is the size of the players in relation to the board.\r\n            We probably need to import some version of the board to\r\n            unity ASAP so we can see the scale first hand and make\r\n            adjustments if needed.\r\n\r\n        2.

For example, Doug's map could be a beginner map\r\n            that takes place in his hometown baseball stadium (which I\r\n            already have some really cool game design ideas for)\r\n            surrounded by his fans who he wants to win for?

The current art for our items is good, but could lead to player\r\n        confusion when, for example, a player is trying to figure out\r\n        what is a regular item vs a regular trap vs a roadblock trap.\r\n        For reference, look at the orbs section on this mario party wiki\r\n        `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Party_6#Orbs`(https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Party_6#Orbs).\r\n        Note that the color of the capsule the item is in determines the\r\n        type of item effect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 20\r\n```text\r\n1.
