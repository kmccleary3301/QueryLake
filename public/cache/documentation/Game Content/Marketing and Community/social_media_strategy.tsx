The content is posted once per week, with peak interaction times identified at 8am, 2pm, 4pm, and 8:30pm.\r\n\r\n### Instagram\r\nInstagram serves as a secondary platform and currently has fewer followers than Twitter. For now, Instagram posts are manually published until an automatic posting solution is implemented.\r\n\r\n## Strategy and Tone\r\nGriffin Games maintains a professional demeanor, focusing on high-quality content without publishing unfinished assets or exaggerations. Cross-platform promotion is employed, and content schedules are adjusted for optimal visibility, aiming for maximum viewer engagement during peak times.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nFocus is placed on maximizing engagement with consistent posting, particularly as game launch approaches. Quality content is a priority, avoiding the sharing of unfinished assets and fostering genuine interaction with the gaming community.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\# Meeting Notes\r\n\r\n\\- Regular meetings to review progress\r\n\r\n\\- Provided feedback on blockout, textures, modeling\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed ideas for events, environments, aesthetics\r\n\r\n\\- Planned content direction and task prioritization\r\n\r\n\\- Coordinated importing Blender scene into Unity\r\n\r\n\\- Shared progress for community updates\r\n\r\n\\- Brainstormed solutions for lighting, foliage, paths\r\n\r\n\\- Reviewed concept art and offered critiques\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed roles, workflows, pipelines\r\n\r\nMarketing\r\n\r\n\\# Social Media Platforms\r\n\r\n\\## Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Main social media focus currently\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nMarketing\r\n\r\n\\# Social Media Platforms\r\n\r\n\\## Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Main social media focus currently\r\n\r\n\\- Goal was 200 followers by end of June 2022 but fell short\r\n\r\n\\- Currently has 129 followers as of April 2022\r\n\r\n\\- Posts character bios and concept art\r\n\r\n\\- Tweets scheduled once per week\r\n\r\n\\- Peak interaction times: 8am, 2pm, 4pm, 8:30pm\r\n\r\n\\## Instagram\r\n\r\n\\- Secondary focus\r\n\r\n\\- Currently has fewer followers than Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Posts same content as Twitter\r\n\r\n\\- Instagram requires connection to Facebook for Buffer to post\r\nautomatically\r\n\r\n\\- Manually posting for now until Facebook account connected\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nPaulie is an avid traveler and a huge foodie.
