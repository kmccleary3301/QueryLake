And not just in the forest; we need critters to fit the themes of each board.\"\r\n\r\nShini's Critter Design Document: \"Critters should have behaviors indicative of their habitat. Podlings in Wetworld can attach to objects and players, aiding or hindering them.\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n**Treecles:** Slow moving tree-like critters that produce a crystally\r\nsweet treat so pals won't chop them down.\r\n\r\n**Mycellians:** Malevolent mushroom-like critters that predate on other\r\ncritters in the forest. They do not have eyes but have deceptively large\r\nand intimidating mouths. The pals of the Enchanted Forest regularly hunt\r\nmycellians, which purportedly make for savory steaks.\r\n\r\n**Wetworld Critters**\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest. They just go with the flow and don't hurt\r\nanybody. Reminiscent of a dandelion seedhead.\r\n\r\n**Treecles:** Slow moving tree-like critters that produce a crystally\r\nsweet treat so pals won't chop them down.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n**Wetworld Critters**\r\n\r\n**Podlings:** A little octopod-like creature that dwells on the\r\nseafloor. Very friendly and cutesy, many pals are fond of them, as they\r\nmake good pets. Due to their \"clingy\" nature, they make great companions\r\nfor exploration because of their tentacle's cushion cups, which allow\r\nthem to grab onto multiple items at once. You can also bounce off the\r\ntops of their heads to launch yourself up into hard to reach areas.\r\n\r\n**Space Station Critters**\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n**Space Station Critters**\r\n\r\n**Aerojellies:** Mysterious jellyfish-like creatures that float about in\r\nspace. Their bodies are made of an extremely low density material and\r\nthey do not behave with any understood intelligence. Rumors say that the\r\nqueen of these strange critters lies somewhere hidden in space.\r\n\r\n## Animations \r\n\r\n### Universal \r\n\r\nDust cloud images used for walking animation\r\n\r\n\\\"Dust Cloud Tail Real.png\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Dust Cloud Tail.png\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Dust Cloud.png\\\"\r\n\r\n### DougModelReal \r\n\r\nThis is a folder for a Unity project that has some tests for the Doug\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n## Prototypes\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\nThere are 4 images showcasing possible Griffin Games logos, each\r\nprogressing to a more specific logo idea\r\n\r\nThere is a section for Concept Art images and videos, including but not\r\nlimited to: Early concepts for characters and the Enchanted Forest, art\r\nfor the critters that could appear in the world of Top Dog, rigging\r\nvideos for the character animations, Top Dog logo art, Host character\r\nand antagonist character art including the early concept art for Phil,\r\nand some shopkeeper art.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\nThis is a spreadsheet for all of our items.\r\n\r\n### Zoom meeting discussing items \r\n\r\n\\\"Item Meeting 8_26_2022.mp4\\\"\r\n\r\n## Characters \r\n\r\n### Playable Character Art \r\n\r\nThese are art assets for the following characters:\r\n\r\nDoug\r\n\r\nFox\r\n\r\nFinn\r\n\r\nDraco\r\n\r\nDoug\r\n\r\nDallas\r\n\r\nClyde\r\n\r\nCatherine\r\n\r\nBonnie\r\n\r\nAntony\r\n\r\n\\\"ClubClubLineupRevise.png\\\" is all the characters in a row\r\n\r\n### NPC Art \r\n\r\nOtis.PNG\r\n\r\nThis is a frog in Enchanted Forest\r\n\r\nFrog.png\r\n\r\nWitch.png\r\n\r\n\\\"Tree Critter\\\".png\r\n\r\nSpacestation_NPC_concept.png\r\n\r\nShopkeeper_owl.png\r\n\r\nShopkeeper_badger.png\r\n\r\nShopkeep_chameleon.png\r\n\r\nShopkeep_chameleon_blank.,png\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\nThe textbook example of an overachiever with a black belt in judo and\r\ndegrees in law, business, and psychology.
