She is recognized for her duality, embodying both the chill, positive persona of her streaming identity and her underlying competitiveness from her favorite game \"DOGA 2\".\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nCatherine's brother suffers from a condition affecting his eyesight, which motivates her to compete in the Top Dog competition to seek more they could do for his condition.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\nCatherine's in-game mechanics revolve around her \"Gamer Rage\" which allows her to mash as she rolls the die, thereby gaining a stronger roll the further behind she is, and can pass through players to steal coins or items.\r\n\r\n### Character Specific Item\r\nCatherine's signature item, the \"`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Gamer Rage`\", strengthens her roll based on her position in the game standings, with an added feature enabling her to pass through other characters, potentially stealing coins or items.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug)\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n* The \"Gamer Rage\" item needs balancing to reflect her ability to make a comeback when behind.\r\n* Potential future updates could more deeply explore her streaming influence on the game's economy.\r\n* Catherine's visuals should capture her streaming aesthetics as well as her competitive drive.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Catherine`\r\n\r\n`GAME FILE LINK: ClubClubCat.png`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n[Chance to get an item, coins, star, good or bad]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Doug's Trap Counter]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Defuses traps]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Catherine\\'s Gamer Gear]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[vanish cap in N64]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[become invisible]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Catherine's charm / catnip (2 votes)]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Charm characters around her in a certain space readius to come to her\r\nand donate]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[Things.
