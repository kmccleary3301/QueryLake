	"content": "Board Only mode in Top Dog emphasizes strategic gameplay on diverse maps with unique items and a central gimmick per board. It's designed for players who prefer a continuous path along the game's boards without interruption from minigames.\r\n\r\n## Boards\r\nBoard design follows a modular approach, with elements inspired by traditional games, such as spaces that can hold traps and dynamic music tailored for each board's theme. Each game map has a looped path with spaces that trigger various events:\r\n\r\n- Blue spaces award coins.\r\n- Red spaces deduct coins.\r\n- Event spaces activate specific board events.\r\n- Shop spaces allow purchasing items from non-moving shops.\r\n- Star spaces are replaced by unique board elements, like collecting golden bones.\r\n\r\n## Items\r\nItems are crucial for strategic play, with each board offering board-specific items. Item usage is limited to one per turn, and some items include:\r\n\r\n- Board-specific items\r\n- Items with increasing strength over time\r\n- Unique Duplicate: Copy an opponent's chosen item\r\n\r\nPlayers can also sell items back for coins and increase the maximum number of held items.\r\n\r\n## Strategy\r\nThe Board Only mode creates a gameplay dynamic where players must weigh each move and interaction carefully. Risk and reward are significant factors, exemplified on maps like Phil's Grand Casino, where the board offers high-stake investment decisions akin to a casino setting.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Enhancements\r\nTo enhance the gameplay experience:\r\n\r\n- Dynamic board elements can significantly alter the gameplay, such as teleporting to new locations with their specific mechanics.\r\n- Feature dynamic music that changes based on location on the board.\r\n  \r\n## Art & Animation\r\n- Environments include detailed 3D boards like the Enchanted Forest.\r\n- Shops and other interactive spaces on the board are represented with unique icons, such as \"`GAME FILE LINK: Tavern_Icon_V2.png`\"\r\n\r\n## Music & Audio\r\n- Each board requires a unique music track, with additional variations for dynamic music change implementation.\r\n\r\n## Tech & Programming\r\n- Use of Cinemachine for camera movement along the board.\r\n- Implement pathfinding for player movement across boards.\r\n- Create UML diagrams and prototypes for board logic.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n- Boards should provide a fun and engaging loop during gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Future Development Ideas\r\n- Consider the possibility of switching to Unreal Engine due to changes in Unity licensing fees.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\- Allow selling items back for coins\r\n\r\n\\- Possible to increase max number of held items\r\n\r\n\\### Items\r\n\r\n\\- Unique items for each board\r\n\r\n\\- Powerful items that gain strength over time\r\n\r\n\\- Allow only 1 item used per turn\r\n\r\n\\### Boards\r\n\r\n\\- Ideas discussed for spaces similar to Mario Party boards\r\n\r\n\\- Blue Space\r\n\r\n\\- Red Space\r\n\r\n\\- Event Space\r\n\r\n\\- Star Space\r\n\r\n\\- Orb Space\r\n\r\n\\- Traps able to be placed on spaces\r\n\r\n\\- Dynamic music changes based on location on board\r\n\r\n\\### Stars\r\n\r\n\\- Collect golden bones as the \\\"star\\\" equivalent\r\n\r\n\\### Mini-games\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n> The main idea I have for players\\' strategy on this board would be to\r\n> make the board about risky investments, almost like you are constantly\r\n> playing a game in a real casino.
