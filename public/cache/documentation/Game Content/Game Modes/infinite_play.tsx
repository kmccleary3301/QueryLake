This mode adopts a \"play until you decide to stop\" approach.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\nPlayers navigate [[Boards]], collect *Items & Power-Ups*, and play [[Mini-Games]]:\r\n\r\n- No default \"final\" turn\r\n- Collection of resources is ongoing\r\n- Board events continue indefinitely\r\n- Mini-game challenges contribute to a continuous scoreboard\r\n- Character development is persistent\r\n\r\n## Strategy and Adaptability\r\nPlayers need to adapt strategies over time as the game evolves.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\nRelevant files and folders for Infinite Play include:\r\n\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Game Modes/Infinite Play`\": Rules and specifics for Infinite Play mode.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\nSee related topics for a better understanding of Infinite Play:\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Infinite Play was created for dedicated players seeking an extended gaming experience.\r\n- Memory and performance optimizations are crucial for Infinite Play's stability.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nSuccess Jingle: plays when a small but positive thing happens to a\r\ncharacter, like getting an item or finding a hidden coin block.\r\n\r\nVictory Tune: plays when the character wins a minigame or buys a star.\r\n\r\nTop Dog Anthem: Plays when the character has won the game and has been\r\ncrowned the Top Dog.\r\n\r\nCharacter timelapse creation video\r\n\r\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\r\n\r\nKickstarter Description\r\n\r\nFinancial Goals and initial timeline info\r\n\r\nCost breakdown - pie chart graphic\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nMeet the Team video\r\n\r\nDefinitely need to show off our office setup.\r\n\r\nShould show how we conduct \\\"research\\\" by playing video games on our\r\ntheater setup.\r\n\r\nDevelopment timeline (?)\r\n\r\nRelease in first half of 2024\r\n\r\nMaybe better to say Q1 or Q2 2024?\r\n\r\nPotential Challenges\r\n\r\nSetting up Workshop support to allow for community modification and\r\ninvolvement in the life of Top Dog\r\n\r\nBalancing all mini games so that they are fun to play and fair, yet\r\nchallenging\r\n\r\nBalancing maps to be fun and exciting no matter how many times you\\'ve\r\nplayed on them.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n### Functionality: \r\n\r\n> Again, I haven't thought up much of an idea for this, but I'll go off\r\n> of the ideas in layout.

Of course, these ideas are more focused on what could be a\r\n            single player experience. I imagine in multiplayer, the\r\n            story is left alone and players just play the map without\r\n            the background stuff. But I feel that designing maps this\r\n            way can really help ground the cast and show why they play\r\n            the game show. Here are some pros and cons I have thought\r\n            of:\r\n\r\n            a.  Pros:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\nPossible Problems\r\n\r\nI could see players doing a \"keep away\" strategy from the winning player\r\nso they can't play the game. This could get pretty frustrating. Perhaps\r\ninstead of points we could do a lives system? That way everyone gets to\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nBalls might have too linear of a trajectory. Try to think of ways to mix\r\nup their movement (balls could hit each other, map mechanics) without\r\ntaking agency away from players who want to aim their shots correctly.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\nMinigame Guide music\r\n\r\n-   A song that plays when you\\'re reading how to play a minigame. **(3\r\n    weeks)**\r\n\r\nMinigame music\r\n\r\n-   There will be (8?) unique songs for minigames. **(3 weeks each song,\r\n    24 weeks total)**\r\n\r\n-   There will need to be variations of each of these songs to implement\r\n    adaptive music. **(1 week each song, 8 weeks total)**.\r\n\r\nMisc. music\r\n\r\n1.

For example, if you exit a village and enter a creepy forest, the\r\nmusic will change to something a bit more ominous sounding. We like to\r\nthink of adaptive music as a way of creating an immersive and cinematic\r\nexperience for the player.\r\n\r\nCharacter Themes\r\n\r\nTo help the characters stand out a little more, each character has their\r\nown set of specific tunes that will play at certain parts of the game.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 9\r\n```text\r\n### How It's Played: \r\n\r\n> Since the players have likely played most other maps to buy this map\r\n> from the store, players know what each board entails in general.\r\n> Therefore, players will create a strategy of going over to the show\r\n> host in the middle of the map and paying them to switch the board to\r\n> their advantage, trying to catch other players in a bad position.\r\n\r\n### Story:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 10\r\n```text\r\n-   Smaller settings menu (change fullscreen/not, volume, etc.)\r\n    (anything that doesn\\'t require a restart)\r\n\r\n(menu art asset list is equally viable as a \"total number of menus\" list\r\nas well, it should be pretty comprehensive spent a lot of time thinking\r\non menus we'd need)\r\n\r\n#### MiniGame Frenzy \r\n\r\n1.
