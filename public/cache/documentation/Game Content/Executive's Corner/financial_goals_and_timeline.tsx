	"content": "The development and launch of Top Dog requires strategic financial planning and a clear timeline to ensure the game's successful release. \r\n\r\n## Financial Goals\r\n\r\nTop Dog's financial goals are established to support a rich gaming experience and strategic market entrance:\r\n\r\n- An initial development phase budget of $50,000, emphasizing core game mechanics. Additional stretch goals envision further enhancements such as new levels, additional characters, and more, scaling up to $300,000.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\nGriffin Games plans a first half of 2024 release for Top Dog, structured to allow comprehensive game testing, community feedback incorporation, and marketing initiatives.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [Kickstarter Planning](/docs/game_content/executives_corner/kickstarter_planning)\r\n- [[Development Process]]\r\n- [[Marketing and Community]]\r\n- [Challenges](/docs/game_content/executives_corner/challenges)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n### Kickstarter Feedback and Planning\r\n\r\nReview the \"JCW Kickstarter Outline & Feedback.docx\" document, outlining JCW's recommendations for the Kickstarter campaign.\r\n\r\n### Trailers and Promotions\r\n\r\nReference \"Kickstarter Trailer Minigame Checklist.pptx\" for a guide on featuring minigames in the Kickstarter trailer.\r\n\r\n### Meeting Recordings\r\n\r\nAccess recorded meetings discussing various development aspects, including minigames and Kickstarter strategy, via provided links.\r\n\r\nRelevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Management/Griffin Games Budget & Schedule.gdoc`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Marketing/Kickstarter Draft.docx`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Marketing/JCW Kickstarter Outline & Feedback.docx`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Marketing/Kickstarter Trailer Minigame Checklist.pptx`\"\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Marketing/Meeting Recordings`\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nKickstarter Description\r\n\r\nFinancial Goals and initial timeline info\r\n\r\nCost breakdown - pie chart graphic\r\n\r\nWe\\'re still working on developing our schedule & budget, but once\r\nwe\\'re finished we should have a good idea of the numbers that would\r\nmake up this pie chart.\r\n\r\nBacker tiers and rewards\r\n\r\nStretch goals - platforms, new levels, characters,etc.\r\n\r\nWe discussed having 5 extra playable characters as stretch goals.\r\n\r\nWe could probably lower our minimum board count to 6, but add 2 boards\r\nas stretch goals. (we could always end up adding both the boards even if\r\nthe stretch goal isn\\'t met)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nWe can have an in-app MP3 player/radio station as a stretch goal that\r\nlets you listen to any music in the game.\r\n\r\nAlso, an important thing to note with stretch goals: we don\\'t have to\r\nimplement all of them by release. Shovel Knight and A Hat in Time\r\npromised a lot of stretch goals, but when it became clear there was no\r\nway to implement all those stretch goals without drastically extending\r\nthe project\\'s development time, the developers just released the games\r\nand slowly added the stretch goals over time. Not very many people were\r\nupset by that.\r\n\r\n-Daniel A.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nBalancing maps to be fun and exciting no matter how many times you\\'ve\r\nplayed on them.\r\n\r\nManaging netcode and anti-cheat to make online play fair and enjoyable\r\n\r\nCreating a developer kit to facilitate the development of community-made\r\nmods\r\n\r\nTracking community feedback to help improve Top Dog\r\n\r\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\r\nSidebar info\r\n\r\nFinancial goals\r\n\r\nOur initial goal should be $50,000.\r\n\r\nWe should have stretch goals that go up to $300,000\r\n\r\ninitial timeline info\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nOur initial goal should be $50,000.\r\n\r\nWe should have stretch goals that go up to $300,000\r\n\r\ninitial timeline info\r\n\r\nWhat kind of info would be needed for a timeline?

Players could be goalies (look up equipment that\r\ngoal jockeys wear) and move back and forth to block as the paddles do.\r\nHowever, it could be more frantic and fun if players had hockey sticks\r\nand could move around the rink, spinning or hitting a button to swing\r\nthe stick to land a goal.\r\n\r\nWe could also change the games name to be something more quippy this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nConcept Image that shows 4 players each controlling a paddle to hit the\r\nball with.\r\n\r\nPossible Idea extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 9\r\n```text\r\nBattle Pong: Battle Pong (Name WIP)\r\n\r\nSimilar to this Pokemon Stadium game: https://youtu.be/9mz-WmzgZyo\r\n\r\nSimilar to pong, but with 4 players that are trying to score goals on\r\none another.\r\n\r\nPlayers take control of their respective \"paddles\" that can have some\r\nsort of angle/mechanic that allows them to aim where the ball goes. Once\r\na ball is hit by a player, that ball changes color and, if scored in\r\nanother player's goal, the player who hit it last receives a point.\r\n\r\nEach time a ball is hit, the speed slightly increases, so it becomes\r\nharder to keep in play.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 10\r\n```text\r\nClassic\r\n\r\nPlay a set number of turns.
