They are known for their friendly nature and are considered excellent companions during underwater exploration.\r\n\r\n![Podling Concept Art](GAME FILE LINK: Podling_Art.png)\r\n\r\nPlayers can benefit from the Podlings' abilities in various scenarios:\r\n\r\n- Bouncing off their heads can propel players to higher, hard-to-reach areas.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\nRelevant files and folders include:\r\n\r\n- Concept art: \"`GAME FILE LINK: boards/Wet World/Concept Art/podlings_concept.png`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [Wetworld Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/wetworld_board)\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n**Treecles:** Slow moving tree-like critters that produce a crystally\r\nsweet treat so pals won't chop them down.\r\n\r\n**Mycellians:** Malevolent mushroom-like critters that predate on other\r\ncritters in the forest. They do not have eyes but have deceptively large\r\nand intimidating mouths. The pals of the Enchanted Forest regularly hunt\r\nmycellians, which purportedly make for savory steaks.\r\n\r\n**Wetworld Critters**\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest. They just go with the flow and don't hurt\r\nanybody. Reminiscent of a dandelion seedhead.\r\n\r\n**Treecles:** Slow moving tree-like critters that produce a crystally\r\nsweet treat so pals won't chop them down.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n**Wetworld Critters**\r\n\r\n**Podlings:** A little octopod-like creature that dwells on the\r\nseafloor. Very friendly and cutesy, many pals are fond of them, as they\r\nmake good pets. Due to their \"clingy\" nature, they make great companions\r\nfor exploration because of their tentacle's cushion cups, which allow\r\nthem to grab onto multiple items at once. You can also bounce off the\r\ntops of their heads to launch yourself up into hard to reach areas.\r\n\r\n**Space Station Critters**\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n\\## Planning\r\n\r\n\\- Effort estimation needed for tasks\r\n\r\n\\- Scheduling Kickstarter campaign\r\n\r\n\\- Financial plans and projections\r\n\r\n\\## Code\r\n\r\n\\- Currently working on minigame code\r\n\r\n\\- Planning online multiplayer\r\n\r\n\\## Community Building\r\n\r\n\\- Working to gain control of r/TopDog subreddit\r\n\r\n\\- Planning social media presence\r\n\r\nWetworld and Space Station\r\n\r\nHere are detailed notes from the Wetworld and Space Station chat\r\nexports, organized into relevant categories and subcategories:\r\n\r\n\\## Wetworld\r\n\r\n\\### Concept Art\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\n\\- Danny said on 4/16/22 that he wouldn\\'t be opposed to a beach world\r\nseparate from Wetworld\r\n\r\n\\### Characters\r\n\r\n\\- On 12/16/22, Konari said he started working on rough concepts for\r\nNPCs in Wetworld after speaking with Danny, and planned to work on them\r\nmore after taking time to decompress from a funeral\r\n\r\n\\## Space Station\r\n\r\n\\### Concept Art\r\n\r\n\\- On 3/24/22, Daniel shared some of Konari\\'s Space Station concept art\r\n\r\n\\- On 4/1/22, Konari shared a cleaner, more traditional station layout\r\nthat kept a similar layout but looked more believable as a game map\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\n\\## Wetworld\r\n\r\n\\### Concept Art\r\n\r\n\\- Lex created some potential concept art on 8/11/22 using Dalle 2\r\nprompts like \\\"A giant ocean-themed board in Mario Party, video game,\r\nhighly detailed, zoomed out, 3d render\\\"\r\n\r\n\\- They created 3 more abstract pieces and 4 more realistic pieces for\r\npotential map inspiration\r\n\r\n\\### Music\r\n\r\n\\- Manch asked on 4/16/22 if a beach world separate from the water world\r\nwould ever happen, and thought it could be cool\r\n\r\n\\- Danny said on 4/16/22 that he wouldn\\'t be opposed to a beach world\r\nseparate from Wetworld\r\n\r\n\\### Characters\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\nUse visual effects to highlight the different locations\r\n\r\nPan up from Wetworld to the Enchanted Forest.\r\n\r\nPan up from Enchanted Forest to Space Station.\r\n\r\nOr maybe pan down from Space Station to Wetworld\r\n\r\n0:30 - 0:45: Show gameplay snippets of maps\r\n\r\nShowcase board events\r\n\r\nShow new item shop mechanics\r\n\r\nemphasis on Enchanted Forest\r\n\r\n0:45 - 0:55: Demonstrate minigames.\r\n\r\nShow all 6 minigames\r\n\r\n0:55 - 1:00: Show off game stats\r\n\r\nNum of minigames\r\n\r\nNum of boards\r\n\r\nNum of characters\r\n\r\n1:20 - 1:30: Demonstrate character creation\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\n**Space Station Critters**\r\n\r\n**Aerojellies:** Mysterious jellyfish-like creatures that float about in\r\nspace.
