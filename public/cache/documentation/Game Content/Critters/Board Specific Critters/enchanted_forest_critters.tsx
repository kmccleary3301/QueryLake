They float around the forest and are harmless to players.\r\n\r\n### Treecles\r\nTreecles are slow-moving tree-like entities. They produce a crystalline sweet which they offer to players to prevent being cut down.\r\n\r\n### Mycellians\r\nMycellians are malevolent mushroom-like creatures without eyes but with large mouths. They prey on other critters of the forest.\r\n\r\n## Critter Interactions\r\nInteractions with critters such as the Dandies, Treecles, and Mycellians influence the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: \"Tree Critter.png\"`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: \"CritterMushroom.png\"`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: \"Enchanted Forest board.PNG\"`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- \"Ensure the behaviors of Mycellians are consistent with their role as predators in the forest.\"\r\n- \"Review critter interactions to balance player advantages.\"\r\n- \"Consider integrating critter-related narrative elements in the Enchanted Forest theme.\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest. They just go with the flow and don't hurt\r\nanybody.
