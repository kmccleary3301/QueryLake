	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nGeneric creatures, also known as critters, contribute to the atmosphere of _Top Dog_ by providing various interactions for players and the game environment. \r\n\r\n## Role in Gameplay\r\n\r\nCritters affect gameplay by adding unpredictability and strategy. Dandies and Podlings offer benefits, while Mycellians add challenge. The behavior of Aerojellies implies there may be special events or rare occurrences involving them.\r\n\r\n## Interaction With Environment\r\n\r\n- **Board Events**: Some critters, like Mycellians, can trigger board events or mini-games.\r\n- **Item Interactions**: Critter behavior may be affected by player items.\r\n- **Hazards or Helpers**: Critters can either be hazards like Mycellians or helpers like Dandies and Podlings.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Enchanted Forest/Enchanted Forest Critters.png`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Critters/Tree Critter.png`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Enchanted Forest Board Features`\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"Critters should augment interaction without disrupting board dynamics.\" - Game Design Lead\r\n- \"Link critter behavior to their board's thematic elements.\" - Lead Programmer\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\nCreate Gimmicks\r\n\r\nTransporters\r\n\r\nChanging orientation\r\n\r\nDifferent walls for the shadow creature\r\n\r\nWalls that can be passed through\r\n\r\nMacGuffin\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want the MacGuffin to be usable\"\r\n\r\nMake the MacGuffin passable\r\n\r\nCreate charge functionality for throwing the MacGuffin\r\n\r\nShadow Creature\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want an enemy to progress the game\"\r\n\r\nCreate assets for the shadow creature\r\n\r\nAI\r\n\r\nMake shadow creature obey rules of the maze\r\n\r\nMake creature chase the player with the MacGuffin\r\n\r\n\"As a player I would like to be eliminated if I am touched by the shadow\r\ncreature\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nA fast moving shadowy creature stalks the maze and rapidly approaches\r\nthe player with the MacGuffin in the most direct path possible. This\r\ncreature obeys most of the laws of the maze (but may be allowed to pass\r\nthrough some special walls depending on balance). Players at any time\r\nmay \"pass\" the MacGuffin directly to any other player on the map, though\r\ncharging the pass may be required depending on distance. Once the\r\nMacGuffin is passed, the shadow creature immediately changes tack to the\r\nnew owner. Players are eliminated if they collide with the shadow\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n\"As a player I would like to be eliminated if I am touched by the shadow\r\ncreature\"\r\n\r\nMake shadow creature eliminate players\r\n\r\nPass MacGuffin to other player on elimination\r\n\r\nExit\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want a way to win the game\"\r\n\r\nMake an exit appear after a period of time\r\n\r\nMake exit position random\r\n\r\nMake the exit only passable with the MacGuffin\r\n\r\n\"As a player I want the game to be more intense towards the end\"\r\n\r\nMake Shadow Creature speed up exponentially after the exit opens\r\n\r\n### Art \r\n\r\nThe following are some art assets for the Top Dog game:\r\n\r\n\"ClubClubDog.png\" Some initial still image of Doug\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n\\- Mushroom creature\r\n\r\n\\- Tree creature\r\n\r\n\\# Art & Animation\r\n\r\n\\## Concept Art\r\n\r\n\\- Shopkeepers\r\n\r\n\\- Host\r\n\r\n\\- Monster characters\r\n\r\n\\- Enchanted forest environments\r\n\r\n\\## Character Art\r\n\r\n\\- 2D character sprites\r\n\r\n\\- 3D character models\r\n\r\n\\- Animations\r\n\r\n\\## Environment Art\r\n\r\n\\- 3D environments for Enchanted Forest board\r\n\r\n\\- 3D environments for minigame arenas\r\n\r\n\\- Props\r\n\r\n\\# Music & Audio\r\n\r\n\\- Looking for music partners\r\n\r\n\\- Discussed deals with Jack and SMLE (electronic artist duo)\r\n\r\n\\- Sound effects\r\n\r\n\\- Voice acting\r\n\r\n\\# Gameplay\r\n\r\n\\## Enchanted Forest Board\r\n\r\n\\- Main board game component with multiple paths\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\n\\- Announcements and events\r\n\r\n\\- Holiday/topical posts\r\n\r\n\\- Milestones and achievements\r\n\r\n\\- Gifs and short video clips\r\n\r\nExecutive Suite\r\n\r\nHere are my detailed notes on the relevant information from the chat\r\nlog:\r\n\r\n\\# Game Concept\r\n\r\n\\- Multiplayer party game with minigames and a board game component\r\n\r\n\\- Set in an enchanted forest with mystical characters\r\n\r\n\\## Other Characters\r\n\r\n\\- Shopkeepers (concept art done but unnamed)\r\n\r\n\\- Host character (concept art done but unnamed)\r\n\r\n\\- Monster characters\r\n\r\n\\- Mushroom creature\r\n\r\n\\- Tree creature\r\n\r\n\\# Art & Animation\r\n\r\n\\## Concept Art\r\n\r\n\\- Shopkeepers\r\n\r\n\\- Host\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\nBonnie is exceptionally good at planning to make sure she comes out on\r\ntop, no matter the outcome.\r\n\r\n## Critter Info \r\n\r\nThis is info about generic creatures that appear on boards, similar to\r\nkoopas or goombas\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Forest Critters**\r\n\r\n**Dandies:** Little floating cartoon fluffballs with eyes that float\r\naround the enchanted forest.
