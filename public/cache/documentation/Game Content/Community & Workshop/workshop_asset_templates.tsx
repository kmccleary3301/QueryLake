	"content": "In \"Top Dog,\" the Workshop Asset Templates provide a framework for developers and community creators to integrate custom content into the game, including characters, items, boards, and minigames.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWorkshop Asset Templates guide creators to develop and share game content in alignment with \"Top Dog's\" design principles and technical specifications.\r\n\r\nTemplates Usage\r\n\r\n- **Character Templates**: Use the base character model and rig to create and animate new characters. Incorporate animations, expressions, and unique abilities for your character concept.\r\n  \r\n- **Board Templates**: Start with basic board layouts or modular environment pieces.\r\n\r\n- **Minigame Templates**: Adhere to the provided UML diagram for consistent logic and player integration.\r\n\r\n- **Item Templates**: Design new items with distinct mechanics using provided scripts and icons.\r\n\r\n## Technical Specifications\r\n\r\nTemplates include documentation for file formats, resolution specifications, and scripting guidelines.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Steam Workshop\r\n\r\n\"Top Dog\" integrates with Steam Workshop for uploading and sharing content. This process includes tagging, version control, and compatibility checks.\r\n\r\nRelevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Character Templates: `GAME FILE LINK: development/character_models`\r\n- Board Templates: `GAME FILE LINK: Boards`\r\n- Minigame Templates: `GAME FILE LINK: Minigames`\r\n- Item Templates: `GAME FILE LINK: Items`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Art & Animation]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Assets`(#minigame-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Time Estimates:`(#minigame-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Assets`(#character-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Time Estimates:`(#character-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shaders`(#shaders)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shader Time Estimates:`(#shader-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX`(#vfx)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: VFX Time Estimates:`(#vfx-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Assets:`(#ui-assets)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Out of game:`(#out-of-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: In Game:`(#in-game-1)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: UI Asset Time Estimates:`(#ui-asset-time-estimates)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Assets:`(#workshop-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Workshop Template Time\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Workshop Assets:`(#workshop-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Workshop Template Time\r\n> Estimate:]](#workshop-template-time-estimate)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Animation:`(#animation)\r\n>\r\n> [[Animation Time Estimates [Total: 17-24\r\n> weeks]]](#animation-time-estimates)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n##### UI Asset Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n#### Workshop Assets: \r\n\r\n-   1 Example \"workshop character\" a good template designed for\r\n    reference (most games with workshop support end up doing this, this\r\n    guy can end up being super basic though so it shouldn\\'t be very\r\n    difficult)\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop minigame\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop map\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   A system/tutorial to animate custom characters\r\n\r\n-   Done well in rivals of aether\r\n\r\n    -   `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert`(https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: General Process:`(#general-process)\r\n>\r\n> `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Map Assets`(#map-assets)\r\n>\r\n> [[Map Time Estimates [Feel free to adjust these are tentative.
