	"content": "Steam Workshop Integration is a feature that allows players to create and share custom content for the game \"Top Dog\" via Steam's Workshop platform. This feature supports the development and distribution of new game elements such as characters, boards, and mini-games.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIntegration with Steam Workshop allows users to download and apply modifications (mods) to the game, enabling new gameplay experiences.\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\nContent creation workflow involves:\r\n\r\n1. **Content Creation**: Design and development of new game assets.\r\n2. **Testing and Validation**: Local testing to ensure compatibility.\r\n3. **Submission**: Submitting mods to the Steam Workshop.\r\n4. **Community Feedback**: Gathering player feedback for improvements.\r\n5. **Update and Maintenance**: Keeping content up-to-date with the game's patches.\r\n\r\n## File Structure\r\nMods are organized into the following categories:\r\n\r\n- **Playable Characters**: Custom character models and skins.\r\n- **Boards**: Custom layouts and themes for boards.\r\n- **Items & Power-Ups**: New items with unique effects on gameplay.\r\n- **Mini-Games**: New or altered mini-games.\r\n- **Art & Animation**: Custom art, icons, and animations.\r\n- **Music & Audio**: Original music and sound effects.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\nDirectories for the above categories:\r\n\r\n- Characters: ``GAME FILE LINK: /Characters/Playable_Characters/*``\r\n- Boards: ``GAME FILE LINK: /Boards/*``\r\n- Items: ``GAME FILE LINK: /Items/*``\r\n- Mini-Games: ``GAME FILE LINK: /MiniGames/*``\r\n- Art: ``GAME FILE LINK: /Art/*``\r\n- Music: ``GAME FILE LINK: /Music/*``\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Art & Animation]]\r\n- [[Music & Audio]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- **Memo**: \"Update the modding documentation with each game patch for mod creators.\"\r\n\r\nThe key to Steam Workshop Integration success is maintaining an active and involved modding community, creating a sustainable ecosystem for \"Top Dog\".\r\n\r\n<Key points extracted and reduced from the original sources provided>\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n##### UI Asset Time Estimates: \r\n\r\n#### Workshop Assets: \r\n\r\n-   1 Example \"workshop character\" a good template designed for\r\n    reference (most games with workshop support end up doing this, this\r\n    guy can end up being super basic though so it shouldn\\'t be very\r\n    difficult)\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop minigame\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   Example \"workshop map\" same idea as above\r\n\r\n-   A system/tutorial to animate custom characters\r\n\r\n-   Done well in rivals of aether\r\n\r\n    -   `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert`(https://rivals-of-aether.fandom.com/wiki/Sandbert)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n#### Networking/Multiplayer: \r\n\r\n1.
