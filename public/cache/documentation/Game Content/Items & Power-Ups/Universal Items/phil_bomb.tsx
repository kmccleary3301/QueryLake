	"content": "## Gameplay Impact\r\n\r\nThe Phil Bomb impacts gameplay by being a trap for players when received from Phil spaces or other players. It introduces unpredictability and necessitates inventory management.\r\n\r\n## Activation and Effects\r\n\r\nPlayers activate the Phil Bomb at the beginning of their turn and it decreases in countdown with each of their subsequent turns. Upon explosion, the player loses 20 coins. The bomb occupies an item slot and a player can discard other items when passing with a full inventory.\r\n\r\n## Phil's Spaces and Events\r\n\r\nPhil's spaces can cause players to get the Phil Bomb, among other detrimental effects such as losing coins or stars, getting sent back to the start, undergoing a revolution, or engaging in group minigames with penalties.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Phil's_Bomb.png`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n  \r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nThe Phil Bomb takes up an item slot and forces the player to discard another item for space. It counts down with each round start and explodes after a set number of turns. The bomb can be acquired through random pools but not purchased in shops.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n##  \r\n\r\n## Phil Actions \r\n\r\nThese are what Phil can do when you land on one of his spaces.\r\n\r\n# What does Phil do \r\n\r\n-   Land on his space what happens?\r\n\r\n-   Lost half your coins\r\n\r\n-   Lose a star\r\n\r\n-   Return to the start\r\n\r\n-   Revolution / communism\r\n\r\n-   Get the bomb item\r\n\r\n-   Group minigame\r\n\r\n    -   Penalty for losing can be 10 coins, 20 coins, half coins, or a\r\n        star\r\n\r\n-   Phil Takeover\r\n\r\n    -   3 random blue/red spaces are turned into Phil spaces.

Should it be\r\n    excluded from Phil Space options if the player has a full inventory?\r\n    If you pass by a player with full inventory, should it just ignore\r\n    the player, giving a meta game to the bomb where players want to\r\n    fill up on inventory space? Should it just boot out one of your\r\n    items? At random or lowest value items?

Again, I feel like this idea can be implemented as\r\n            discreetly or open as we want. On the side of discreet, we\r\n            can imply it happens and never acknowledge it ever again\r\n            throughout development. On the more open side, this gives us\r\n            options to make a Phil casino map, lightly themed casino\r\n            \"Phil\" minigames, and a Phil character skin specifically for\r\n            that map later in development, similar to how there are\r\n            bowser maps at the end of MP games.

From a player's perspective, this could be nothing more than\r\n            subtle nods to this kind of story by implying that Phil\r\n            supplies the game with the casino items. It would give an\r\n            implicit explanation to why there are these casino items in\r\n            a game that is all about the \"game show\" theme. On top of\r\n            this, it could provide a default story answer to why a\r\n            player goes from 1st to 4th or vice versa. Players can now\r\n            think like \"Phil wanted me to lose/win!\" instead of \"The\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\n### Story: \r\n\r\n> Phil has invited the characters to his casino for a fun night\r\n> celebrating the Top Dog contestants.

It could provide for a really\r\n        cool single player mode later down the line, and even greater,\r\n        Phil minigames could be based on different casino games, which\r\n        are \"always rigged in favor of the house.\" If we think that this\r\n        is a cool direction for the game, I can try writing up a story\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\n2)  What should be the effect of it blowing up?
