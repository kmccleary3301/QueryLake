	"content": "The Polarity Inverter is an item within \"Top Dog,\" designed to reverse the positive and negative values of board spaces.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Effect\r\n\r\nThe Polarity Inverter, when activated, changes the consequence of landing on specific board spaces for a set number of turns. Beneficial spaces will now penalize the player, and previously negative spaces will provide benefits.\r\n\r\n## Acquisition and Rules\r\n\r\nPlayers can obtain the Polarity Inverter through item shops, random item spaces, or specific board events. Once used, the Polarity Inverter's effect encompasses the entire board for all players. The player must declare their intention to use it before rolling the die.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n### Usage and Balancing\r\n\r\n- The number of turns the Polarity Inverter affects might need to be limited to maintain game balance.\r\n- Adjust availability and cost based on playtesting feedback.\r\n\r\n### Potential Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Visual effects to indicate the altered state of the board.\r\n\r\n### Communication\r\n\r\n- Clearly communicate the item's effect and duration to all players.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal_Items/Polarity_Inverter.asset``\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Item Shops`\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Board Events`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## Roll Booster \r\n\r\nCan roll higher than highest allowed value for a few turns\r\n\r\n## [Flip flop / rewind]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Change direction of the board (like whistle in MP)]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Growth Item]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Starts as a 1-3 die and gains 1-3 spaces each turn]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Quick Spender]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Starts high and loses spaces over time]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Polarity Inverter]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Reverses positive and negative values of board spaces]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Unique Duplicate]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Choose an opponent, gain a copy of their chosen item]{.mark}\r\n\r\n# Forest Specific \r\n\r\n## [Stun spore hat (2 Votes)]{.mark}\r\n```"
