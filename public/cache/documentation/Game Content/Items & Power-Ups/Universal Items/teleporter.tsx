The first part, the receiver, is placed by the player. The player can activate the second part to teleport back to the placed receiver. It is a one-time use item.\r\n\r\n## In-Game Representation\r\n\r\nIn Top Dog, the Teleporter is represented by a pair of devices.\r\n\r\n## Relevance to Gameplay\r\n\r\nThe Teleporter allows a player to control their movement, leaping across the board to a predetermined destination.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Universal Items assets: \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal_Items/Teleporter.asset`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [[Game Modes]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"The Teleporter's UX flow needs a bit more polish. Make sure the placement and activation steps are clear.\" - Dev Memo\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n> location it has teleported to.
