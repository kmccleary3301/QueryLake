	"content": "The **Roll Booster** is an item available to players in the game *Top Dog*. This item allows players to exceed the usual maximum roll value for a few turns.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\nPlayers can use the Roll Booster to increase their die roll value temporarily, offering strategic advantages during gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Interaction with Characters\r\nAll Playable Characters can utilize the Roll Booster, affecting gameplay dynamics.\r\n\r\n## Limitations and Balance\r\nThe Roll Booster can roll higher than the highest allowed value for a few turns. Its use is bounded by a limited number of turns.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\nRelevant assets and game development files related to the Roll Booster item can be found in the directory:\r\n\r\n- <|\"Items/Universal Items/Roll Booster|\">\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## Curse Roll: \r\n\r\n1)  It sounds like discussion did not end on this item, so we need to\r\n    bring it back up\r\n\r\n[Solution: Idea 1: Select 2 out of 10 numbers (OR roll dice twice to\r\nrandomly get two numbers).

When this item is used, have players skip this turn's roll.

For the turn they use it, the space they are\r\n        standing on may or may not activate its effect again (depends on\r\n        balance).
