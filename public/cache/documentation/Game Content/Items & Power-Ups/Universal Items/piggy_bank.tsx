The item is not sold in the final 5 turns of a game.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/Piggy_Bank_Item.png`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n2)  What should be the effect of it blowing up?

I currently\r\n    have it set in the system as capping out at 15 coins.\r\n\r\nSolution: Costs 10 coins with no cap. Not sold at 5 turns remaining.\r\n\r\n## Declaration Die: \r\n\r\n1)  In order for this mechanic to work, I see two ideas:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\nb.  Minigames\r\n\r\n## Art\r\n\r\nc.  General\r\n\r\nd.  NPCs\r\n\r\n    i.  Eventually we will need an NPC/method of obtaining items from\r\n        the free item space (kind of like the capsule machine of MP5\r\n        `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://www.mariowiki.com/Capsule_machine`(https://www.mariowiki.com/Capsule_machine)\r\n        ). We could have a \"dealer\" or one of those bank teller guys at\r\n        casinos that gives you chips for the spaces where free items are\r\n        given out. Perhaps even easier, we could do a chip machine that\r\n        just distributes random chips.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\n## Banana Peel: \r\n\r\n1)  Reconsider price/reconsider giving taken coins to the owner of the\r\n    trap/reconsider coins taken. Right now at only costing 5 coins, this\r\n    is a must buy as a roadblock item, as the item pays for itself and\r\n    gives extra back. No risk involved.\r\n\r\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\r\nall.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Break the Bank:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\n## Bounce Off: \r\n\r\n1)  Using the rest of a player's dice roll could prove menacing, as\r\n    someone could triple dice into moving backwards for a star. Not\r\n    terrible, but may lead to players not buying the item in favor of an\r\n    item like Break the Bank.\r\n\r\n[Keep the same]{.mark}\r\n\r\n# Enchanted Forest Items \r\n\r\n##  \r\n\r\n## Mystery Mushroom:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\r\nall.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Break the Bank: \r\n\r\n1)  Same problem as Banana Peel giving coins back to the owner of the\r\n    trap, the trap pays for itself and more as a roadblock. In fact,\r\n    these two items are basically the same except the toll stops the\r\n    player's movement, making banana peel an inferior item in the case\r\n    they can be bought at the same price.\r\n```"
