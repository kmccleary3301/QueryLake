	"content": "The *Double Up Tennis Ball* is a strategic item in the `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Top Dog` game, used to amplify in-game advantages temporarily.\n\n## Functionality\nThe item doubles the effects of another item or action. For instance, it can double a die roll, enabling the player to move twice the number of spaces on the board. \n\n## Usage and Acquisition\nThe *Double Up Tennis Ball* can be acquired through item shops, or as a random item on the board.\n\n## Developer Notes\n- Balancing the item with other game elements is essential.\n- It should remain a rare asset to maintain game balance.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n- [Universal Items Icon Sheet](GAME FILE LINK: development/art_and_animation/resources_and_assets/items/universal_items_icon_sheet.pdn)\n- [Item Usage and Mechanics Documentation](GAME FILE LINK: development/game_content/items_and_power-ups/gameplay_mechanics/item_usage_docs.gdoc)\n\n## See Also\n- [[Universal Items]]\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Board Gameplay Mechanics`\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Minigame Design`\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\nConcept Image that shows 4 players each controlling a paddle to hit the\nball with.\n\nPossible Idea extensions\n\nMaybe have two ball variations, a big ball that moves slower worth 2\npoints and a regular 1 point ball? Maybe just a variation of the regular\nball but it's golden (like how mario party does) and worth more points\n\nMoving platforms that can block balls to mix up play?\n\nAs far as art, we could incorporate the players moving the paddles or it\ncould look similar to a neon version of pong. Visuals could be simple in\nthat case\n\nPossible Problems\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n## [Double Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \n\n## [Triple Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \n\n## [AoE Delayed Trap]{.mark} \n\n## [Affect multiple spaces and happens after X turns]{.mark}\n\n## [Lose 10 coins if in the zone]{.mark}\n\n## [Steal 5 coins from players in the zone]{.mark}\n\n## [Trap Protection]{.mark} \n\n## [Item Stealing]{.mark} \n\n-   [Trap space or 1 time use?]{.mark}\n\n## [Trap Card Trap]{.mark} \n\n-   [You buy and place it, if someone lands on it you (the trap owner)\n    pick what to duel for]{.mark}\n\n## [Star Ticket]{.mark} \n\n-   [If in inventory when buying a star can buy 2 stars]{.mark}\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n[Drop it in player's inventory as you pass them]{.mark}\n\n## [Piggy Bank]{.mark} \n\n[Starts at 0 coins, gains 2 each turn]{.mark}\n\n## [Teleporter]{.mark} \n\n[Drop receiver item and use other half to tp back]{.mark}\n\n-   [1 time use]{.mark}\n\n## [Declaration Die]{.mark} \n\n[Choose where you will go next turn.

Once\na ball is hit by a player, that ball changes color and, if scored in\nanother player's goal, the player who hit it last receives a point.\n\nEach time a ball is hit, the speed slightly increases, so it becomes\nharder to keep in play.\n```\n\n#### Source 5\n```text\nBall needs to speed up slightly each time it is hit by a paddle\n\nBall slows down when colliding with other balls, try using Math.Clamp to\nlock it at its current speed as a min and a max speed so it doesn't go\ntoo fast.\n\nChange paddles to work with the current control system.\n\nStory Ideas\n\nGame could take place on ice, with the players as goal jockeys. Would\nexplain why pucks (not balls) glide so easily\n\nPucks could come in from the corners this way, would be easier to prep\nfor them being pitched in.\n```\n\n#### Source 6\n```text\nEach time a ball is hit, the speed slightly increases, so it becomes\nharder to keep in play.\n\nBalls spawn in slowly at first, but more can spawn in over time.\n\n1-3 maps with small variations to make the game more interesting.\n\nThings that need to be done when coming back to work on this game\n\nChange paddle shape to be angled\n\nBall needs to change color when the front of the paddle hits it, not\nsides or back. It also needs to change the variable lastPlayerHit to the\ncorrect player when it changes color.\n\nBall needs to speed up slightly each time it is hit by a paddle\n```\n\n#### Source 7\n```text\nWarp_Trap.png\n\nUniversal_Items.png\n\nUniversal_Items_2.png\n\nTriple_Up_Tennis_Ball_Item.png\n\nTriple_Up_Tennis_Ball_Item (1).png\n\nTrap_Repellant.png\n\nTrap_Card_Item.png\n\nTeleport V2.png\n\nSteal PickPocket Item.png\n\nReverse_Tennis_Dirty.png\n\nReverse_Tennis_Ball_Item.png\n\nReverse_Tennis_Ball_Item_V2.png\n\nReverse_Mush_Item (1).png\n\nPortal_Item.png\n\nPortal Item.png\n\nPortal Item Maybe.png\n\nPiggy_Bank_Item.png\n\nPhil\\'s_Bomb.png\n\nLavender_Sprig.png\n\nGolden_Ticket_Item.png\n\nGolden_Mic_Item.png\n\nGameGambler Item.png\n\nDouble_Up_Tennis_Ball_Item.png\n\nDelayed_Trap_Item.png\n\nDeclaration_Die.png\\'\n```\n\n#### Source 8\n```text\nb.  When this item is used, have players skip this turn's roll. To\n        compensate, the custom roll choice max is doubled or near\n        doubled (max number of 10-12) so they don't technically lose out\n        on distance. For the turn they use it, the space they are\n        standing on may or may not activate its effect again (depends on\n        balance). This item may confuse players who have played mario\n        party before and are familiar with the custom block\n\n2)  We could either go this route or just revert back to the custom dice\n    from mario party\n```\n\n#### Source 9\n```text\n\\- Quickdraw duel\n\n\\- 2D platformer\n\n\\- Asteroid shooter\n\n\\- Squid game parody\n\n\\- Falling platforms\n\n\\- Will support single player, local co-op, and online\n\n\\## Characters\n\n\\- Each player selects from a number of characters before starting\n\n\\- Characters have different attributes affecting dice rolls\n\n\\- Players can customize characters via outfits, colors, accessories\n\n\\- Abilities planned:\n\n\\- Double dice roll\n\n\\- Double mini-game rewards\n\n\\- Immunity from traps\n\n\\- Free items\n\n\\## Items\n\n\\- Players collect items by purchasing at shops or winning mini-games\n```\n\n#### Source 10\n```text\nPossible Problems\n\nI could see players doing a \"keep away\" strategy from the winning player\nso they can't play the game. This could get pretty frustrating. Perhaps\ninstead of points we could do a lives system? That way everyone gets to\nplay.\n\nBalls might have too linear of a trajectory. Try to think of ways to mix\nup their movement (balls could hit each other, map mechanics) without\ntaking agency away from players who want to aim their shots correctly.\n```\n\n#### Source 11\n```text\nLittle Wars:\n\n-   Little Wars\n\n    -   Each player gets a variety of troops to select from then deploys\n        them on the battlefield.\n\n    -   Free for All\n\n    -   Here was an image showing the 4 players each placed on their own\n        island.
