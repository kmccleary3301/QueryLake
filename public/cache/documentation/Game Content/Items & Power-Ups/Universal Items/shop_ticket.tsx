The ticket is available exclusively in random orb spaces and cannot be bought from shops.\r\n\r\n## Mechanics\r\n\r\nA Shop Ticket allows the player to purchase items at a reduced cost, affecting the player's strategy. Its rarity adds value and enhances the excitement of exploring orb spaces.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/Shop Ticket`: Contains all assets for the Shop Ticket.\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Game Economy`\r\n\r\n### Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- The item's availability and impact on game balance should be monitored during playtesting. Players' pursuit and satisfaction with the Shop Ticket need to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n# Universal \r\n\r\n## Wish bone: \r\n\r\nbreak it in half, get a chance to get extra coins after each task\r\n\r\n## [Wet Fish:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[characters can\\'t land on same space who got slapped or pass\r\nthem]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[last 1 turn]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[can be used on self or others]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Shop Ticket:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Discount on next item you buy (50%, more or less depends on\r\nbalance)]{.mark}\r\n\r\n-   [Only appears in random orb spaces, can't buy in shop]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Game Chooser]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Pick 2v2, FFA, 1v3, etc or choose 1 from a random 5]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Roll Booster \r\n\r\nCan roll higher than highest allowed value for a few turns\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n\\- Witch\\'s hut\r\n\r\n\\- Used for item upgrading\r\n\r\n\\- Spooky aesthetic\r\n\r\n\\- Surrounded by pine trees\r\n\r\n\\- Lit cauldron\r\n\r\n\\- Pumpkin patch\r\n\r\n\\- Thorny plants\r\n\r\n\\- Tavern\r\n\r\n\\- Large building\r\n\r\n\\- Second shop with high value items\r\n\r\n\\- Attached outhouse\r\n\r\n\\- Mushroom shop\r\n\r\n\\- Located by riverbank\r\n\r\n\\- Fairy ring with glowing sprites\r\n\r\n\\## Paths\r\n\r\n\\- Main path starts in town and climbs tree\r\n\r\n\\- Alternate risk/reward routes\r\n\r\n\\- Paths use dirt and stone textures\r\n\r\n\\- Glowing mushrooms mark some paths\r\n\r\n\\- Vines crossing path in some areas\r\n\r\n\\## Backgrounds\r\n\r\n\\- Distant village on right with exaggerated shapes\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n-   Game summary screen, with game performance metrics\r\n\r\n-   Achievement progress menu [OPTIONAL]\r\n\r\n##### In Game: \r\n\r\n-   Dialogue Boxes with choices\r\n\r\n-   Shop menu\r\n\r\n-   Player UI (has amount of coins, stars, etc)\r\n\r\n```{=html}\r\n<!-- -->\r\n```\r\n-   Minigame Menu/Tutorial (when the minigame is loading up)\r\n\r\n-   High Risk/Reward option explanation (that way nobody accidentally\r\n    uses one of those)\r\n\r\n-   Item menu (choose and use items)\r\n\r\n-   Smaller settings menu (change fullscreen/not, volume, etc.)\r\n    (anything that doesn\\'t require a restart)\r\n\r\n##### UI Asset Time Estimates:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\n2)  What should be the effect of it blowing up?

In my simulation currently, pretty much all items can be in\r\n    shops or obtained through orb spaces at equally random rates, which\r\n    can cause some balance problems such as some players getting a 5\r\n    cost double dice while others get a 20 cost teleporter.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\n2)  As a follow up to 1, Consider this video at timestamp 15:07\r\n    `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ZSCwohL84`(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ZSCwohL84)\r\n    where, in some mario parties, including 6, they had item tables to\r\n    determine what items appeared in shops, at orb spaces, including\r\n    only a very specific number of items in each board, etc. In short,\r\n    is there a comprehensive way to evaluate how we distribute items so\r\n    that it is balanced for all players?\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 9\r\n```text\r\nSolution: Hold 4 items\r\n\r\n## Character Item Questions: \r\n\r\n1)  Where should players be able to get their character items? These\r\n    items are extremely good with very effective powers. Currently I\r\n    have them only spawn in the high tier item shop (currently these are\r\n    preceded by risky spaces such as phil spaces) to keep them from\r\n    affecting the game too much.

Character items are very strong, new items that deserve unique\r\n        ways of obtaining it, better than just having a high tier item\r\n        shop, which is very similar to Mario Party. How I think of it,\r\n        every map should have a simple and cool way to get the items.\r\n        Here is an example:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 17\r\n```text\r\n1.

The way it drops and you\r\n            pick it up would fall to the strength of the mechanic, but\r\n            the acorns take up an item slot. Players can then go down to\r\n            what is currently the high tier item shop and (maybe) pay a\r\n            small fee to open it like a loot box. The acorn could\r\n            include various items, but should be the only way to get\r\n            your character item.
