	"content": "The \"Game Gambler\" is an item in the party game \"Top Dog.\" It effects the mini-game round by offering a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Impact\r\nActivating the Game Gambler item before a mini-game starts signals the game to potentially double the coin reward for the player upon victory. However, it comes with the risk of losing the chance at extra coins if not successful. Its impact on game balance is a concern, as discussed in development.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nA game mechanic must check for the activation of the Game Gambler. On confirmation, the program will conditionally boost the holder's reward after a successful mini-game. Ensuring proper interaction with other elements and updating the user interface to reflect the increased stakes is necessary.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Game Data/Items/GameGamblerItem.png` - Image representing the Game Gambler item.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n- [[Mini-Games]]\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nPlaytesting the influence of the Game Gambler on game balance is important. Accounting for potential impacts on player behavior and ensuring the item's design encourages calculated risk-taking without causing frustration is critical. Visual and audio cues are required to communicate the active boosted stakes during gameplay clearly.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n\\### Stars\r\n\r\n\\- Collect golden bones as the \\\"star\\\" equivalent\r\n\r\n\\### Mini-games\r\n\r\n\\- Shell game where players try to avoid picking cup with ball\r\n\r\n\\- Western duel/quick draw mini-game\r\n\r\n\\- Rhythm game with button prompts\r\n\r\n\\- Memory game with counting objects\r\n\r\n\\- Cooking mechanic to combine items\r\n\r\n\\- First-person shooter with silly weapons\r\n\r\n\\- Falling rock dodge game\r\n\r\n\\- Robot racing game\r\n\r\n\\- Pod racing game\r\n\r\n\\## Visuals\r\n\r\n\\### UI\r\n\r\n\\- Main menu as town square area\r\n\r\n\\- Menus styled as backstage rooms\r\n\r\n\\- Dice roll animations\r\n\r\n\\- Gashapon capsule animations\r\n\r\n\\### Characters\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\nIn addition to these two game description sections, we should probably\r\nhave a section that addresses the question \\\"What sets Top Dog apart\r\nfrom the competition?\\\" This can be where we discuss our vision for\r\nmodding & community involvement.\r\n\r\nA fourth section discussing the alternate game modes in the game could\r\nalso be good.\r\n\r\nAlternate Game Mode Ideas:\r\n\r\nInfinite Play (Game continues until players decide to end the game)\r\n\r\nCompetitive and Casual playlists\r\n\r\nMini Games only\r\n\r\nBoard only\r\n\r\nSetting/Game World graphic & description\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n\\- Boss spaces initiate a boss mini-game\r\n\r\n\\- Shop spaces allow item purchases\r\n\r\n\\- Star spaces let you collect stars\r\n\r\n\\- Players take turns moving around the board and triggering events\r\n\r\n\\- After each turn, a short mini-game takes place\r\n\r\n\\## Mini-Games\r\n\r\n\\- Short competitive mini-games happen after every turn\r\n\r\n\\- Mini-games test skills like precision, speed, memory, etc\r\n\r\n\\- Outcome determines rewards like coins and stars\r\n\r\n\\- Mini-game themes planned:\r\n\r\n\\- Quickdraw duel\r\n\r\n\\- 2D platformer\r\n\r\n\\- Asteroid shooter\r\n\r\n\\- Squid game parody\r\n\r\n\\- Falling platforms\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 4\r\n```text\r\nShell Game:\r\n\r\n-   elimination shell game where if you pick the cup that has the ball\r\n    you get knocked out of the game it\\'s partially based on reflex,\r\n    since two players can\\'t select the same cup, so whoever picks it\r\n    first gets it\r\n\r\nCounting Game:\r\n\r\n-   Counting a number of animals/objects in a complex scene, making the\r\n    winner accuracy based\r\n\r\nSpot the Difference:\r\n\r\n-   A spot the difference game (winner is whoever finds the most\r\n    differences)\r\n\r\nBattle Pong: Battle Pong (Name WIP)\r\n\r\nSimilar to this Pokemon Stadium game: https://youtu.be/9mz-WmzgZyo\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 5\r\n```text\r\n{Instagram Banner}\r\n\r\nFollow us on Instagram to keep up with our game's art!\r\n\r\nShort Game Description (1-2 paragraph)\r\n\r\nMaybe this should be a short pitch to highlight what we want to change\r\nabout the party game genre.\r\n\r\n{Story Banner}\r\n\r\n{1-2 paragraphs highlighting story/setting}\r\n\r\n{Features}\r\n\r\nItem shop\r\n\r\nItems\r\n\r\nHow we want our item system to be different from other games\r\n\r\nHighlight some cool unique items\r\n\r\nDemonstrate strategic uses\r\n\r\nUnique Board Events\r\n\r\nPromote high risk high reward\r\n\r\nUnique spaces\r\n\r\nGame rules customization\r\n\r\nCan choose what minigames you want to play\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 6\r\n```text\r\n\\## Gameplay\r\n\r\n\\- Turn-based board game with mini-games after each turn, similar to\r\nMario Party\r\n\r\n\\- 4 playable characters per game, taken from player\\'s collection or\r\ndefaults\r\n\r\n\\- Customizable characters and boards via Steam Workshop\r\n\r\n\\- Single-player, local mutliplayer, and online multiplayer options\r\nplanned\r\n\r\n\\# Game Development\r\n\r\n\\## Technology\r\n\r\n\\- Using Unity game engine\r\n\r\n\\- GitHub for version control\r\n\r\n\\- 3D models created in Blender\r\n\r\n\\- 2D art created in Aseprite, Photoshop, etc.\r\n\r\n\\## Concerns\r\n\r\n\\- Recent changes to Unity licensing fees may force switch to Unreal\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\n`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MypZiw-uninMtADtvKHu0QHhv1JsMNRd`(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MypZiw-uninMtADtvKHu0QHhv1JsMNRd)\r\n\r\n### Minigame Descriptions \r\n\r\nThe following items will describe minigames for the Top Dog game with a\r\ntitle and description of gameplay.
