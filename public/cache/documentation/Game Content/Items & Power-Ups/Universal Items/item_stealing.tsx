It is designed to be a strategically important mechanic with balanced risk and reward elements.\r\n\r\n## Mechanics\r\n\r\nItem Stealing is initiated through landing on designated board spaces or winning certain mini-games. A successful steal allows a player to obtain an item from the target's inventory.\r\n\r\n## Balance\r\n\r\nTo prevent frequent disruptive use of Item Stealing, it is a higher-cost action.
