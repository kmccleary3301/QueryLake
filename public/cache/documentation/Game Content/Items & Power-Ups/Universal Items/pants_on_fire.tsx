	"content": "Pants On Fire is a `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: universal item` in \"Top Dog\" used to disrupt opponents' strategies.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\n\r\nActivated as a roadblock, Pants On Fire uses the remaining movement of the affected player. The player has no control over where to go and cannot interact with pass-by events like shops and stars. It removes control from the player, deviating from usually predictable movements.\r\n\r\n## Item Implementation and Strategy\r\n\r\nPants On Fire is a consumable trap available through item shops. It's used at a cost, affecting players who do not pay a set number of coins to avoid consequences.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal_Items/Pants_On_Fire.png`\": Visual representation of Pants On Fire.\r\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Game_Data/Items/Universal_Items.json`\": Contains properties and parameters for Pants On Fire.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- \"[[Items & Power-Ups]]\"\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Consideration for an item counter to display for strategic play due to its psychological impact on gameplay.\r\n\r\nPants On Fire requires players to use strategy and timing for its effective use within the game.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n2)  Should the toll of the trap be equivalent to the coins put in by a\r\n    player like the thwomp gates from more recent mario parties? In this\r\n    case, should the player just pay a custom price upon placing the\r\n    trap, instead of having 4 different items in a shop causing\r\n    confusion for the player?\r\n\r\n[Solution: Stops the player if they don\\'t want to pay 10 coins. If they\r\npay 10 coins it goes to the owner. This is a 1 time use item.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Pants on Fire:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n## Pants on Fire: \r\n\r\n1)  Is this a roadblock or regular trap? If roadblock, does it use the\r\n    rest of your roll or send you forward a random amount? Basically,\r\n    should this item function as it does in Mario Party 5, where it\r\n    moves the player randomly 10 spaces forward (It also removed all\r\n    capsules from a player's inventory).\r\n\r\n[Solution: Roadblock that uses the remaining movement. No control over\r\nwhere to go and you cannot interact with pass-by events like shops and\r\nstars, does not pass off phil's bomb]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Curse Roll:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\nSeconds Before Disaster: Two characters are acting as seconds in an 18th\r\ncentury style pistol duel.

Players select\r\na box without knowing what's inside, while their characters hide the\r\nchosen weapon under a large worn cloak.
