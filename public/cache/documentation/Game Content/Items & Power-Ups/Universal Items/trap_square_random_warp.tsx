	"content": "Trap Square Random Warp is an item in the party game \"Top Dog\". Players can use this item to place a teleportation trap on the game board, which remains invisible to other players. When triggered, it randomly teleports the triggering player to a different board position.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\n\r\nUpon activation, the Trap Square Random Warp can potentially transport a player closer or further from objectives like the `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Golden Bone` or various [[Items & Power-Ups]]. Its unpredictable nature can disrupt player strategies.\r\n\r\nThe item strategically interacts with [Phil Bomb](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/phil_bomb) and [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks), enabling layers of tactics.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n* Universal Item Icons: \"`GAME FILE LINK: resources/assets/items/universal/trap-square-random-warp-icon.png`\"\r\n* Gameplay Logic Scripts for Items: \"`GAME FILE LINK: programming/items/logic/trap-square-random-warp.js`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n* [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n* [Phil Bomb](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/phil_bomb)\r\n* [[Characters]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n* The randomness of the Trap Square Random Warp is a core element for balancing.\r\n* Play-testing will continue to optimize its frequency and gameplay impact.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## [Paulie's food coma]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Drop food around the map, expired or fresh, good and bad]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Paulie Trap Tech]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[More powerful traps.
