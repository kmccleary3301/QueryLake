	"content": "## Overview\nThe \"Bounce Off\" item in *Top Dog* changes the movement direction of the targeted player to move backwards for the remainder of their dice roll.\n\n## Functionality\nWhen activated, Bounce Off immediately reverses the affected player's movement. Strategic deployment can prevent opponents from reaching advantageous board locations.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal_Items/Bounce_Off.png`\n\n## See Also \n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\n- [[Universal Items]]\n- [[Boards]]\n\n## Developer Notes\n- Maintain balance to prevent Bounce Off from becoming overly frustrating.\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\n**Wetworld Critters**\n\n**Podlings:** A little octopod-like creature that dwells on the\nseafloor. Very friendly and cutesy, many pals are fond of them, as they\nmake good pets. Due to their \"clingy\" nature, they make great companions\nfor exploration because of their tentacle's cushion cups, which allow\nthem to grab onto multiple items at once. You can also bounce off the\ntops of their heads to launch yourself up into hard to reach areas.\n\n**Space Station Critters**\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n## Curse Roll: \n\n1)  It sounds like discussion did not end on this item, so we need to\n    bring it back up\n\n[Solution: Idea 1: Select 2 out of 10 numbers (OR roll dice twice to\nrandomly get two numbers). If the player you used the item on rolls one\nof those numbers, they don't move and the user of the item moves that\nnumber instead.]{.mark}\n\n[Idea 2: The item is global to everyone's next turn. Selection works\nlike Idea 1. If anyone rolls the one of two numbers chosen, they don't\nmove.]{.mark}\n\n## Bounce Off:\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n## Bounce Off: \n\n1)  Using the rest of a player's dice roll could prove menacing, as\n    someone could triple dice into moving backwards for a star. Not\n    terrible, but may lead to players not buying the item in favor of an\n    item like Break the Bank.\n\n[Keep the same]{.mark}\n\n# Enchanted Forest Items \n\n##  \n\n## Mystery Mushroom:\n```\n\n#### Source 4\n```text\nUnhandy Dandies: Players are dandy ranchers tasked with rounding up\nstray dandies.
