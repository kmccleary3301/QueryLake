This effect lasts for one turn and can be used on oneself or others.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Impact\r\n\r\nUtilizing the `Wet Fish` hinders player progression and introduces a strategic element to board navigation. Players must alter their paths and rethink their strategies for one turn.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\nThe `Wet Fish` offers versatile tactical use: to secure a position or to prevent an opponent from advancing towards a key space.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Items and Power-Ups: Universal Items: \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/Wet Fish.asset`\"\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Gameplay Mechanics`\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Board Events and Strategy`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n# Universal \r\n\r\n## Wish bone: \r\n\r\nbreak it in half, get a chance to get extra coins after each task\r\n\r\n## [Wet Fish:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[characters can\\'t land on same space who got slapped or pass\r\nthem]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[last 1 turn]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[can be used on self or others]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Shop Ticket:]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Discount on next item you buy (50%, more or less depends on\r\nbalance)]{.mark}\r\n\r\n-   [Only appears in random orb spaces, can't buy in shop]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Game Chooser]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Pick 2v2, FFA, 1v3, etc or choose 1 from a random 5]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Roll Booster \r\n\r\nCan roll higher than highest allowed value for a few turns\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n> This map would truly encapsulate everything we want to focus on with\r\n> Top Dog: customizability.
