	"content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nUnique Duplicate is an item in the `Top Dog` party game that allows a player to copy an opponent's chosen item. It helps in counterbalancing rival advantages and strategic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Integration\r\n\r\nUnique Duplicate can be acquired from the in-game item shop. It replicates items affecting dice rolls and other gameplay aspects.\r\n\r\n## Strategic Use\r\n\r\nStrategically, Unique Duplicate levels the playing field when an opponent has a powerful item and is used with other gameplay events.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: [Items/Unique Duplicate.md]`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Gameplay Mechanics`\r\n- [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"Balance implementation of Unique Duplicate.
