	"content": "## Overview\n\n\"Curse Roll\" is a unique item in the game *Top Dog*.\n\n## Gameplay Mechanics\n\nUpon acquiring a Curse Roll, players may cast it on an adversary during their turn before rolling to move. The cursed player then selects two numbers between 1 and 10. If the cursed player rolls one of these numbers in their next turn, they do not move and the player who used the Curse Roll moves that number of spaces instead.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Cursed_Roll.png`\": This is the item's icon asset.\n\n## Developer Notes\n\n- The Curse Roll should introduce strategic variability on the board.\n- The item might loop or chain effects based on balance considerations.\n- We are still discussing the final version of the item.\n- Playtest feedback is crucial for balance.\n- An animation to indicate the Curse Roll's use might be added.\n- The item is global to everyone's next turn.\n\n## See Also\n\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Phil's Bomb`\n- [Piggy Bank](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/piggy_bank)\n- [Declaration Die](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/declaration_die)\n- [Shopkeepers](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/shopkeepers)\n- [Item Stealing](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/item_stealing)\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\n## Curse Roll: \n\n1)  It sounds like discussion did not end on this item, so we need to\n    bring it back up\n\n[Solution: Idea 1: Select 2 out of 10 numbers (OR roll dice twice to\nrandomly get two numbers). If the player you used the item on rolls one\nof those numbers, they don't move and the user of the item moves that\nnumber instead.]{.mark}\n\n[Idea 2: The item is global to everyone's next turn. Selection works\nlike Idea 1. If anyone rolls the one of two numbers chosen, they don't\nmove.]{.mark}\n\n## Bounce Off:\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n## Pants on Fire: \n\n1)  Is this a roadblock or regular trap? If roadblock, does it use the\n    rest of your roll or send you forward a random amount? Basically,\n    should this item function as it does in Mario Party 5, where it\n    moves the player randomly 10 spaces forward (It also removed all\n    capsules from a player's inventory).\n\n[Solution: Roadblock that uses the remaining movement.

When this item is used, have players skip this turn's roll. To\n        compensate, the custom roll choice max is doubled or near\n        doubled (max number of 10-12) so they don't technically lose out\n        on distance. For the turn they use it, the space they are\n        standing on may or may not activate its effect again (depends on\n        balance).
