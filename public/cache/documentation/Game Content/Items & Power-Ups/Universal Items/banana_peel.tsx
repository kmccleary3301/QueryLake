It is deployed onto board spaces to create obstacles for opponents.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Impact\r\n\r\nUpon stepping on a space with a Banana Peel, the player's character slips and is halted immediately, losing any additional movement for the turn.\r\n\r\n## Item Description\r\n\r\nThe Banana Peel stops a player's advancement without incurring a coin penalty.\r\n\r\n## Usage and Limitations\r\n\r\nThe Banana Peel is a one-time-use trap item, it serves as a movement control tool.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Universal_Items.png`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Universal_Items_2.png`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Item Shop`\r\n- [Board Events and Gimmicks](/docs/game_content/boards/board_events_and_gimmicks)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n> The Banana Peel stops the player in their tracks and does not drop coins. It provides a strategic tool that alters the movement of opponents.\r\n\r\n> â€“ Game Design Team\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\r\nall.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Break the Bank: \r\n\r\n1)  Same problem as Banana Peel giving coins back to the owner of the\r\n    trap, the trap pays for itself and more as a roadblock. In fact,\r\n    these two items are basically the same except the toll stops the\r\n    player's movement, making banana peel an inferior item in the case\r\n    they can be bought at the same price.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n2)  We could either go this route or just revert back to the custom dice\r\n    from mario party\r\n\r\n3)  Side note: may need to rethink the name, as we are not using dice\r\n    for Top-Dog, presumably the icon would be on a coin\r\n\r\nSolution: Activate start of turn, roll normal. At the end of move,\r\nchoose the roll you want. Start of next turn you move to that space.\r\n\r\n## Banana Peel:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n## Banana Peel: \r\n\r\n1)  Reconsider price/reconsider giving taken coins to the owner of the\r\n    trap/reconsider coins taken. Right now at only costing 5 coins, this\r\n    is a must buy as a roadblock item, as the item pays for itself and\r\n    gives extra back. No risk involved.\r\n\r\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\r\nall.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Break the Bank:\r\n```"
