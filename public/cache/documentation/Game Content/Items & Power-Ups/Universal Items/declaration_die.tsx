The item is a one-time use and is consumed after activation.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/item_system/DeclarationDieLogic.cs`\n\n## See Also\n- [[Playable Characters]]\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\n\n## Developer Notes\nThe *Declaration Die* was created to introduce a skill-based strategy to the game, based on community feedback regarding random elements in party games. It does not partake in random item distribution like the Phil Space actions.\n\n`GAME FILE LINK: Declaration_Die.png`\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\n## Declaration Die: \n\n1)  In order for this mechanic to work, I see two ideas:\n\n    a.  Have the player act out their turn as normal, and if they didn't\n        use an item yet, let them choose to use the declaration after\n        this turn's roll for the next turn. I can see this confusing\n        players as to when they are allowed to use items.\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n## Piggy Bank: \n\n1)  Should there be a cap to how many coins you can get with this item?\n    Personal opinion: I think there should, as the item is very good at\n    only costing 5 coins and giving a payout after 2 turns. I currently\n    have it set in the system as capping out at 15 coins.\n\nSolution: Costs 10 coins with no cap. Not sold at 5 turns remaining.\n\n## Declaration Die: \n\n1)  In order for this mechanic to work, I see two ideas:\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n[Drop it in player's inventory as you pass them]{.mark}\n\n## [Piggy Bank]{.mark} \n\n[Starts at 0 coins, gains 2 each turn]{.mark}\n\n## [Teleporter]{.mark} \n\n[Drop receiver item and use other half to tp back]{.mark}\n\n-   [1 time use]{.mark}\n\n## [Declaration Die]{.mark} \n\n[Choose where you will go next turn.
