	"content": "The Trap Card Trap is an item in Top Dog that allows players to set up strategic gameplay elements on the board.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanic\r\n\r\nWhen a player acquires a Trap Card Trap, they place it on a board square. It is invisible to others until triggered, at which point the trap owner chooses the duel stakes when an opponent lands on it.\r\n\r\n## Strategic Use\r\n\r\nStrategically placing the Trap Card Trap on high-traffic squares or near key resources can deter opponents. It may also interact with other gameplay elements as suggested in internal discussions.\r\n\r\n## Balancing Mechanics\r\n\r\nThe Trap Card Trap's appearance and utility are balanced to maintain fair gameplay, which may include special accessibility conditions such as availability in shops or during events.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Items/Trap_Card_Item.png``\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n- [Item Stealing](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/item_stealing)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n- \"Monitoring playtest data to adjust the Trap Card Trap balance. - Dev Team\"\r\n- \"Possible cooldown mechanism for the Trap Card Trap. - Internal Playtest Feedback\"\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## [Double Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Triple Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [AoE Delayed Trap]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Affect multiple spaces and happens after X turns]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Lose 10 coins if in the zone]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Steal 5 coins from players in the zone]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Trap Protection]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Item Stealing]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [Trap space or 1 time use?]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Trap Card Trap]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [You buy and place it, if someone lands on it you (the trap owner)\r\n    pick what to duel for]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Star Ticket]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [If in inventory when buying a star can buy 2 stars]{.mark}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n## [Catherine's Gamer Rage]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Mash as you roll and get a stronger roll]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[Die is more powerful if you're further behind]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[Pass through people and steal coins/items]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Clyde's traps]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [Throw a lot of traps]{.mark}\r\n\r\n-   [Firework esc device launches 5-6 traps anywhere on the\r\n    board]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Paulie\\'s plane ticket (2 votes)]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Choose and fly to any space on the board then roll a die]{.mark}\r\n\r\n### Items Spreadsheet \r\n\r\nThis is a spreadsheet for all of our items.\r\n\r\n### Zoom meeting discussing items \r\n\r\n\\\"Item Meeting 8_26_2022.mp4\\\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 3\r\n```text\r\n## Clyde's Trap Explosion: \r\n\r\n1)  How many traps should it deploy?
