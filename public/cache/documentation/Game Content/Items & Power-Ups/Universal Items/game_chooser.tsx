	"content": "`Game Chooser` is an item in `Top Dog` which allows players to select from a choice of random mini-games. It integrates with the turn-based gameplay by influencing the types of mini-games players engage in next. The `Game Chooser` interface reflects the game's dynamic content settings including the addition or removal of mini-games.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe `Game Chooser` allows players to shape the course of the game by selecting mini-games that suit their strategy or preferences, with categories including `2v2`, `Free-for-All (FFA)`, `1v3`, etc. It adapts to the real-time modifications of the game's content.\n\n## In-Game Integration\n\nWhen players encounter the `Game Chooser`, it presents an intuitive interface that's consistent with the general visual design of the game. Its design ensures players can quickly understand their choices without disrupting the game flow.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n\n- ``GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/Game Chooser.psd`` â€“ Photoshop document for the `Game Chooser` icon.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [[Mini-Games]]\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\n- [[Development Process]]\n\n## Developer Notes\n\n- The `Game Chooser` is designed to be compatible with the inclusion of future mini-games, allowing for expandability post-launch.\n- Any mini-games that are disabled in the game settings should not appear in the `Game Chooser`'s offerings to ensure consistency with current player settings in `Community & Workshop`.\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\n\\### Stars\n\n\\- Collect golden bones as the \\\"star\\\" equivalent\n\n\\### Mini-games\n\n\\- Shell game where players try to avoid picking cup with ball\n\n\\- Western duel/quick draw mini-game\n\n\\- Rhythm game with button prompts\n\n\\- Memory game with counting objects\n\n\\- Cooking mechanic to combine items\n\n\\- First-person shooter with silly weapons\n\n\\- Falling rock dodge game\n\n\\- Robot racing game\n\n\\- Pod racing game\n\n\\## Visuals\n\n\\### UI\n\n\\- Main menu as town square area\n\n\\- Menus styled as backstage rooms\n\n\\- Dice roll animations\n\n\\- Gashapon capsule animations\n\n\\### Characters\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\nIn addition to these two game description sections, we should probably\nhave a section that addresses the question \\\"What sets Top Dog apart\nfrom the competition?\\\" This can be where we discuss our vision for\nmodding & community involvement.\n\nA fourth section discussing the alternate game modes in the game could\nalso be good.\n\nAlternate Game Mode Ideas:\n\nInfinite Play (Game continues until players decide to end the game)\n\nCompetitive and Casual playlists\n\nMini Games only\n\nBoard only\n\nSetting/Game World graphic & description\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n\\- Boss spaces initiate a boss mini-game\n\n\\- Shop spaces allow item purchases\n\n\\- Star spaces let you collect stars\n\n\\- Players take turns moving around the board and triggering events\n\n\\- After each turn, a short mini-game takes place\n\n\\## Mini-Games\n\n\\- Short competitive mini-games happen after every turn\n\n\\- Mini-games test skills like precision, speed, memory, etc\n\n\\- Outcome determines rewards like coins and stars\n\n\\- Mini-game themes planned:\n\n\\- Quickdraw duel\n\n\\- 2D platformer\n\n\\- Asteroid shooter\n\n\\- Squid game parody\n\n\\- Falling platforms\n```\n\n#### Source 4\n```text\nShell Game:\n\n-   elimination shell game where if you pick the cup that has the ball\n    you get knocked out of the game it\\'s partially based on reflex,\n    since two players can\\'t select the same cup, so whoever picks it\n    first gets it\n\nCounting Game:\n\n-   Counting a number of animals/objects in a complex scene, making the\n    winner accuracy based\n\nSpot the Difference:\n\n-   A spot the difference game (winner is whoever finds the most\n    differences)\n\nBattle Pong: Battle Pong (Name WIP)\n\nSimilar to this Pokemon Stadium game: https://youtu.be/9mz-WmzgZyo\n```\n\n#### Source 5\n```text\n{Instagram Banner}\n\nFollow us on Instagram to keep up with our game's art!\n\nShort Game Description (1-2 paragraph)\n\nMaybe this should be a short pitch to highlight what we want to change\nabout the party game genre.\n\n{Story Banner}\n\n{1-2 paragraphs highlighting story/setting}\n\n{Features}\n\nItem shop\n\nItems\n\nHow we want our item system to be different from other games\n\nHighlight some cool unique items\n\nDemonstrate strategic uses\n\nUnique Board Events\n\nPromote high risk high reward\n\nUnique spaces\n\nGame rules customization\n\nCan choose what minigames you want to play\n```\n\n#### Source 6\n```text\n\\## Gameplay\n\n\\- Turn-based board game with mini-games after each turn, similar to\nMario Party\n\n\\- 4 playable characters per game, taken from player\\'s collection or\ndefaults\n\n\\- Customizable characters and boards via Steam Workshop\n\n\\- Single-player, local mutliplayer, and online multiplayer options\nplanned\n\n\\# Game Development\n\n\\## Technology\n\n\\- Using Unity game engine\n\n\\- GitHub for version control\n\n\\- 3D models created in Blender\n\n\\- 2D art created in Aseprite, Photoshop, etc.\n\n\\## Concerns\n\n\\- Recent changes to Unity licensing fees may force switch to Unreal\n```\n\n#### Source 7\n```text\n`UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MypZiw-uninMtADtvKHu0QHhv1JsMNRd`(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MypZiw-uninMtADtvKHu0QHhv1JsMNRd)\n\n### Minigame Descriptions \n\nThe following items will describe minigames for the Top Dog game with a\ntitle and description of gameplay.

Game shows naturally need to show what the characters stand\n            to win, and any good game show will get you invested in the\n            characters so you care if they win. Additionally, for a new\n            game IP, I feel that it is important for us to establish who\n            these characters are, where they live in their world, why\n            they want to compete in the game show, etc. Frankly, I think\n            that just saying the characters want to be the \"Top Dog\"\n            doesn't really show the personality we gave them.\n```\n\n#### Source 14\n```text\n-   Waiting to join/ queue menu\n\n    -   Join code generation/input menu to invite people via codes\n\n-   Workshop content menu (enable/disable/view mods)\n\n-   Battle Pass/Quest Menu\n\n    -   Cosmetic menu, to switch between cosmetics\n\n-   Map selection menu\n\n    -   Possible map settings menu (deciding what is enabled/disabled\n        for a game)\n\n    -   Character select menu\n\n-   Game summary screen, with game performance metrics\n\n-   Achievement progress menu [OPTIONAL]\n\n##### In Game: \n\n-   Dialogue Boxes with choices\n\n-   Shop menu\n```\n\n#### Source 15\n```text\n10 main characters and their bios\n\nOther characters\n\nMain antagonist\n\nHost (is the host the main antagonist?)\n\nK.K.
