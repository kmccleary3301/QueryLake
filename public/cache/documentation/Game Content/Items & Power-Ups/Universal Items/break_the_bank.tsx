	"content": "## Overview\n\n**Break The Bank** is a trap item in **Top Dog** used to strategically impact player movement on the board.\n\n## Gameplay Effect\n\nThe item stops another player's movement entirely if they encounter it; it does not drop coins or provide a toll.\n\n## Strategy Incorporation\n\nPlacement of the Break The Bank item influences the tactical decisions of other players in managing their path on the board.\n\n## In-game Balance\n\nTo maintain balance, the Break The Bank item is set to cost 10 coins and is not available in shops when there are 5 turns remaining.\n\n## Relevant Files/Folders\n\n- \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Piggy_Bank_Item.png`\": Visual representation of the item.\n\n## Developer Notes\n\nThe presence and implementation of the Break The Bank item should align with the strategic aspects of the game without being too disruptive to player experience.\n\n![Break The Bank Item](GAME FILE LINK: BreakTheBank_Item.png)\n\n## Cited Document Text Segments\n\n#### Source 1\n```text\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\nall.]{.mark}\n\n## Break the Bank: \n\n1)  Same problem as Banana Peel giving coins back to the owner of the\n    trap, the trap pays for itself and more as a roadblock. In fact,\n    these two items are basically the same except the toll stops the\n    player's movement, making banana peel an inferior item in the case\n    they can be bought at the same price.\n```\n\n#### Source 2\n```text\n## Banana Peel: \n\n1)  Reconsider price/reconsider giving taken coins to the owner of the\n    trap/reconsider coins taken. Right now at only costing 5 coins, this\n    is a must buy as a roadblock item, as the item pays for itself and\n    gives extra back. No risk involved.\n\n[Solution: Stops the player in their tracks. Does not drop coins at\nall.]{.mark}\n\n## Break the Bank:\n```\n\n#### Source 3\n```text\n## Bounce Off: \n\n1)  Using the rest of a player's dice roll could prove menacing, as\n    someone could triple dice into moving backwards for a star. Not\n    terrible, but may lead to players not buying the item in favor of an\n    item like Break the Bank.\n\n[Keep the same]{.mark}\n\n# Enchanted Forest Items \n\n##  \n\n## Mystery Mushroom:\n```\n\n#### Source 4\n```text\nb.  Minigames\n\n## Art\n\nc.  General\n\nd.  NPCs\n\n    i.  Eventually we will need an NPC/method of obtaining items from\n        the free item space (kind of like the capsule machine of MP5\n        `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: https://www.mariowiki.com/Capsule_machine`(https://www.mariowiki.com/Capsule_machine)\n        ). We could have a \"dealer\" or one of those bank teller guys at\n        casinos that gives you chips for the spaces where free items are\n        given out. Perhaps even easier, we could do a chip machine that\n        just distributes random chips.\n```\n\n#### Source 5\n```text\n2)  What should be the effect of it blowing up? Lose coins, or something\n    more creative that affects items/stars or your area on the board?\n\n[Solution:]{.mark}\n\n[Bomb takes up an item slot. Passing a full inventory, that player\nchooses an item to discard. Utilize both passing and round-start\ncounting down. Bomb explodes, lose 20 coins. Can be gotten in random\npool, but not in shops]{.mark}\n\n## Piggy Bank:\n```\n\n#### Source 6\n```text\n## Piggy Bank: \n\n1)  Should there be a cap to how many coins you can get with this item?\n    Personal opinion: I think there should, as the item is very good at\n    only costing 5 coins and giving a payout after 2 turns. I currently\n    have it set in the system as capping out at 15 coins.\n\nSolution: Costs 10 coins with no cap. Not sold at 5 turns remaining.\n\n## Declaration Die: \n\n1)  In order for this mechanic to work, I see two ideas:\n```\n\n#### Source 7\n```text\n\\- Different spacesuit designs for inside vs outside station\n\n\\- Screenshots rendered of environments to showcase art\n\n\\- Both day and night time versions\n\n\\- With and without board spaces\n\n\\- Discussions on lighting and halo effects\n\nMinigames:\n\n\\- No Cakewalk\n\n\\- Cake environment design and decorations\n\n\\- Glass bridge modeling and breaking animations\n\n\\- Camera angles and banners discussed\n\n\\- Failing Upwards\n\n\\- Modular building pieces for procedural generation\n\n\\- Small tricky platforms like AC units\n\n\\- Overall theming and modeling\n\n\\- Bandstand\n\n\\- Theater curtain animation\n```\n\n#### Source 8\n```text\nSolution: Hold 4 items\n\n## Character Item Questions: \n\n1)  Where should players be able to get their character items? These\n    items are extremely good with very effective powers. Currently I\n    have them only spawn in the high tier item shop (currently these are\n    preceded by risky spaces such as phil spaces) to keep them from\n    affecting the game too much. Is there a better way to distribute\n    these items?\n\n### Item Ideas \n\nThis is a document with some ideas for items.\n\n# Universal \n\n## Wish bone: \n\nbreak it in half, get a chance to get extra coins after each task\n```\n\n#### Source 9\n```text\n# Universal \n\n## Wish bone: \n\nbreak it in half, get a chance to get extra coins after each task\n\n## [Wet Fish:]{.mark} \n\n[characters can\\'t land on same space who got slapped or pass\nthem]{.mark}\n\n[last 1 turn]{.mark}\n\n[can be used on self or others]{.mark}\n\n## [Shop Ticket:]{.mark} \n\n[Discount on next item you buy (50%, more or less depends on\nbalance)]{.mark}\n\n-   [Only appears in random orb spaces, can't buy in shop]{.mark}\n\n## [Game Chooser]{.mark} \n\n[Pick 2v2, FFA, 1v3, etc or choose 1 from a random 5]{.mark}\n\n## Roll Booster \n\nCan roll higher than highest allowed value for a few turns\n```\n\n#### Source 10\n```text\n## [Battal buzzer:]{.mark} \n\n[create a duel for coins/stars]{.mark}\n\n## [Reverse Mushroom:]{.mark} \n\n[Go backwards.
