Originally known as \"Dandy's Candy\", it allows players to feed Dandies – whimsical and floating creatures – which then transport the player to the Golden Bone, an essential win-objective.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Impact\r\n\r\nThe Golden Mic, when used, attracts Dandies that carry the player towards the Golden Bone, offering a shortcut to victory.\r\n\r\n## Obtainment\r\n\r\nThe item can be acquired in-game, at locations like shops.\r\n\r\n![Golden Mic Item](GAME FILE LINK: Golden_Mic_Item.png)\r\n\r\n## Strategy Considerations\r\n\r\nStrategic use of the Golden Mic is crucial, as it can significantly alter the game’s state and offer a major advantage when used at the right moment.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nBalance is a key consideration in the inclusion of the Golden Mic, ensuring it complements the game without overpowering other elements.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- Golden Mic Item Model: \"`GAME FILE LINK: Items/Universal Items/Golden_Mic_Item.png`\"\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Character Animations`\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n[Drop it in player's inventory as you pass them]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Piggy Bank]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Starts at 0 coins, gains 2 each turn]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Teleporter]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Drop receiver item and use other half to tp back]{.mark}\r\n\r\n-   [1 time use]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Declaration Die]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Choose where you will go next turn.
