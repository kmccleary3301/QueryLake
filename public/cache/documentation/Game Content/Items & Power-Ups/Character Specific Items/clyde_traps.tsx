	"content": "Clyde is a character in \"Top Dog\" with a trait centric around creating and deploying traps. Clyde Traps are used to interact with opponents on the game board strategically.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanism\r\n\r\nClyde can deploy traps on the board, which have a variety of effects and counterplay options.\r\n\r\n### Setting Traps\r\n\r\n- Traps can be activated after a set number of turns [[AoE Delayed Trap]{.mark}].\r\n- They may target multiple spaces [[Affect multiple spaces and happens after X turns]{.mark}].\r\n\r\n### Effects of Clyde Traps\r\n\r\n- Traps can cause opponents to lose coins [[Lose 10 coins if in the zone]{.mark}].\r\n- Traps can steal coins from players [[Steal 5 coins from players in the zone]{.mark}].\r\n\r\n## Strategy and Counterplay\r\n\r\nPlayers can strategize the placement of Clyde's Traps and opponents can anticipate and avoid them, highlighting an adaptive strategy in gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/character_models/clyde.blend`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: game_design/items/clyde_traps.docx`\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: art/concept_art/clyde_traps_sketch.pdn`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [[Boards]]\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [Clyde](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/clyde)\r\n- `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Traps`\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\n**Technical Discussion Extract (April 2, 2023):**\r\n- Investigating the AI's behavior in interactions with Clyde's Traps for consistency and fairness in solo play sessions.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## [Double Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Triple Up Tennis Ball]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [AoE Delayed Trap]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Affect multiple spaces and happens after X turns]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Lose 10 coins if in the zone]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Steal 5 coins from players in the zone]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Trap Protection]{.mark} \r\n\r\n## [Item Stealing]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [Trap space or 1 time use?]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Trap Card Trap]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [You buy and place it, if someone lands on it you (the trap owner)\r\n    pick what to duel for]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Star Ticket]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [If in inventory when buying a star can buy 2 stars]{.mark}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n## Clyde's Trap Explosion: \r\n\r\n1)  How many traps should it deploy?
