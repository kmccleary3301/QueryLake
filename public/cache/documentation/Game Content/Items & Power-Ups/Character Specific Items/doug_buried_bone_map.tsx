	"content": "## Introduction\r\nThe \"Doug Buried Bone Map\" is a character-specific item associated with the character [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug) within the game \"Top Dog\". This item influences his playstyle on the game boards.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Application\r\nThe \"Doug Buried Bone Map\" offers clues to guide Doug to a hidden golden bone within the game's environment, providing him with a large bounty of points. It may also grant extra benefits like bonus items or temporary abilities.\r\n\r\n## Impact on Board Dynamics\r\nPossession of the map shifts Doug's focus to exploring the board and unearthing the golden bone, affecting his and his competitors' strategies.\r\n\r\n## Interactions with Board Features and Other Characters\r\nThe map's activation can influence player interactions with board features like `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Shopkeeper` decisions. Competitors like [Clyde](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/clyde) may alter their strategies in response to Dougâ€™s actions.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: \"Art & Animation/Character Art and Icons/Doug/Doug_Treasure_Map.png\"`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [Doug](/docs/game_content/characters/playable_characters/doug)\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n> \"Ensure the buried bone map offers a balanced advantage and interesting counterplay for competitors.\" - Game Design Team\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n> This map would truly encapsulate everything we want to focus on with\r\n> Top Dog: customizability.

My idea is, going forward, what if we designed maps,\r\n            characters, and the game show purpose as a whole around the\r\n            individual places our characters come from and their\r\n            aspirations? For example, Doug's map could be a beginner map\r\n            that takes place in his hometown baseball stadium (which I\r\n            already have some really cool game design ideas for)\r\n            surrounded by his fans who he wants to win for? Clyde's map\r\n            could take place in the city he grew up in, jumping and\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\na.  Pros:\r\n\r\n                i.  In my (limited) art knowledge, I feel like maps such\r\n                    as Doug's baseball stadium may be pretty easy to\r\n                    make compared to Enchanted Forest? It could also\r\n                    help expedite the process of trying to come up with\r\n                    crazy new map ideas. It could even provide a basis\r\n                    for expansions, where we add a character's map and\r\n                    item alongside the character themself.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 8\r\n```text\r\nii. Unlike Mario Party, which doesn't exactly have to\r\n                    show off character personalities or why they want to\r\n                    be the superstar because their world is already\r\n                    established, Top Dog could establish the world and\r\n                    characters in one motion.\r\n\r\n                iii. Some current theorized maps, such as the beach map,\r\n                     could be turned into character maps, such as the\r\n                     shark character having his map.\r\n\r\n            b.

Again, I feel like this idea can be implemented as\r\n            discreetly or open as we want. On the side of discreet, we\r\n            can imply it happens and never acknowledge it ever again\r\n            throughout development. On the more open side, this gives us\r\n            options to make a Phil casino map, lightly themed casino\r\n            \"Phil\" minigames, and a Phil character skin specifically for\r\n            that map later in development, similar to how there are\r\n            bowser maps at the end of MP games.
