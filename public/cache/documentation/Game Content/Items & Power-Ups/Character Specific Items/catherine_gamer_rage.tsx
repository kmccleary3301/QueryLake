	"content": "## Description\r\nCatherine's Gamer Rage is a unique character-specific item in Top Dog, associated with the character Catherine. This item harnesses her hidden competitive spirit, allowing for comebacks during gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Impact\r\nWhen activated, Catherine's Gamer Rage allows the player to mash the button as she rolls the dice to achieve a stronger roll. The intensity of her roll grows more powerful if she is further behind, and as Catherine passes through other players, she can steal coins or items.\r\n\r\n## Item Activation\r\nCatherine's Gamer Rage is triggered during her turn before rolling the dice.\r\n\r\n## Implementation in Gameplay\r\nPlayers controlling Catherine must strategically determine when to use this item for maximal impact on the game.\r\n\r\n## Visual and Audio Effects\r\nActivating Gamer Rage results in distinct visual effects, such as a glowing aura around Catherine's character model.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Characters/Catherine/Cats_Gamer_Rage.png`\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [[Characters]]\r\n- [[Items & Power-Ups]]\r\n- [[Playable Characters]]\r\n- [[Character Specific Items]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- It is important to balance Catherine's Gamer Rage to prevent it from being overpowered.\r\n- Visual signals during the activation should be distinctive but should not excessively distract players.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n[Chance to get an item, coins, star, good or bad]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Doug's Trap Counter]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Defuses traps]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Catherine\\'s Gamer Gear]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[vanish cap in N64]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[become invisible]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## [Catherine's charm / catnip (2 votes)]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Charm characters around her in a certain space readius to come to her\r\nand donate]{.mark}\r\n\r\n[Things.

They know their\r\nkid brother tunes in to their stream and they don't want to be setting a\r\nbad example. Long-time fans continue to tease them for their previous\r\nlack of inhibitions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 7\r\n```text\r\nCatherine's brother suffers from a condition that is slowly degenerating\r\nhis eyesight.
