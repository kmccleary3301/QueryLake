	"content": "Reap And Sow is an item specific to the Enchanted Forest board in Top Dog. This item offers a strategic layer to gameplay, allowing players to plant seeds for potential future gain that converts into items with an increase in value.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\nPlayers can plant seeds in designated areas on the board, which grow into random items after a certain number of turns. This can offer advantages to the player and is a key element for space control on the Enchanted Forest board.\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\nConsideration is being given to adjusting seed growth rates to ensure balance in the game. There is also discussion on tying the Reap And Sow mechanics with other Enchanted Forest-specific events.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Reap_Sow_Item_V3.png`: The final icon for the Reap And Sow item.\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: development/character_models/Enchanted Forest Items/Reap_Sow_Item_V2.png` : An earlier version of the item icon.\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Boards/Enchanted Forest/Tavern Area Art Pass/Art Pass Tavern Area.png` : Art assets and completed visuals for the tavern area, which might include the item shop where Reap And Sow can be purchased.\r\n\r\n## See Also \r\n- [Phil Bomb](/docs/game_content/items_powerups/universal_items/phil_bomb)\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n- [[Enchanted Forest Items]]\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## Call of the Forest: \r\n\r\n1)  Same problem as Mystery Mushroom, we need concrete effects for the\r\n    good and bad.\r\n\r\n2)  On top of the good and bad effects, should it be random what it does\r\n    to each player? Should it reward the user more often than not?\r\n\r\n[Solution: Turn into a happening space, choose what animal you want to\r\nhelp you.]{.mark}\r\n\r\n## Reap and Sow: \r\n\r\n1)  How much would we want the items to upgrade by? In other words,\r\n    should item growing be capped at a max of 10 coins of growth?\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Source 2\r\n```text\r\n# Item Systems \r\n\r\n## General Questions: \r\n\r\n1)  We need to have a discussion on what items can be bought, what items\r\n    can be randomly gotten (witch vs reap and sow vs item give-away\r\n    spaces). In my simulation currently, pretty much all items can be in\r\n    shops or obtained through orb spaces at equally random rates, which\r\n    can cause some balance problems such as some players getting a 5\r\n    cost double dice while others get a 20 cost teleporter.\r\n```"
