	"content": "The *Mystery Mushroom* is an item exclusive to the [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board), presenting players with a gamble that could result in either beneficial or detrimental outcomes. Upon use, the effects of the *Mystery Mushroom* are randomized, offering a chance for either a significant advantage or unforeseen setback. The item is visually represented as a capricious mushroom, embodying the unpredictable nature of the forest itself.\r\n\r\n## Effects and Mechanics\r\nWhen activated, the *Mystery Mushroom* delivers a 50/50 split of potential events that could either give coins, take them away, or transform into another item, including a dreaded `UNKNOWN ARTICLE LINK: Phil's Bomb`. There's a 0.5% chance for an event that is either incredibly favorable or catastrophic directly related to the lore of the item being a relic of the forest's ancient magic.\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- `GAME FILE LINK: Enchanted_Forest_Items/Mystery_Mush_Item.png`: The icon of the *Mystery Mushroom* as depicted in the game's UI.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board)\r\n- [[Universal Items]]\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\"Keep the same\" – Game Balancing Lead\r\n\r\n\"Solution: Give coins, take away coins.
