	"content": "## Overview\r\n\"Call Of The Forest\" is an item in Top Dog, a multiplayer party game with thematic boards and mini-games. The item is specific to the \"Enchanted Forest Board\".\r\n\r\n## Gameplay Mechanics\r\nThe \"Call Of The Forest\" item allows players to spawn random forest creatures, choosing from three types of critters: Dandies, Treecles, and Mycellians. Each has different interactions with the player: Dandies and Treecles are helpful, while Mycellians negatively affect other players.\r\n\r\n![Call of the Forest Usage](GAME FILE LINK: Call_Of_The_Forest_V1.png)\r\n![Call of the Forest Version 2](GAME FILE LINK: Call_Of_The_Forest_V2.png)\r\n\r\n## Relevant Files/Folders\r\n- [|Items/Enchanted Forest Items/Call_Of_The_Forest_V1.png|]\r\n- [|Items/Enchanted Forest Items/Call Of The Forest V2.png|]\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [Enchanted Forest Board](/docs/game_content/boards/themespecific_boards/enchanted_forest_board)\r\n- [Critters](/docs/game_content/characters/nonplayable_characters/critters)\r\n- [Enchanted Forest Critters](/docs/game_content/critters/board_specific_critters/enchanted_forest_critters)\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n- Consider balance and interaction with other items in the Enchanted Forest board.\r\n- Assess possibility of choosing which animal assists the player.\r\n\r\n## Cited Document Text Segments\r\n\r\n#### Source 1\r\n```text\r\n## [Star Ticket]{.mark} \r\n\r\n-   [If in inventory when buying a star can buy 2 stars]{.mark}\r\n\r\n# Forest Specific \r\n\r\n## [Mystery Mushroom (2 votes)]{.mark} \r\n\r\n[Could be good, could be bad.
