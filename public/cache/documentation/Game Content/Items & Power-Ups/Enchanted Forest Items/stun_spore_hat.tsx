Shovel Knight and A Hat in Time\r\npromised a lot of stretch goals, but when it became clear there was no\r\nway to implement all those stretch goals without drastically extending\r\nthe project\\'s development time, the developers just released the games\r\nand slowly added the stretch goals over time.
